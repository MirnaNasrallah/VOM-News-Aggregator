Join Simon Burnton', '38 mins: Nearly a chance for United! A bit of a snarl-up on the right ends with Mazraoui running free and the referee waving play on. Dalot is sprinting into all sorts of space on the left but he tries to pull back to Fernandes, whose heels are clipped by Jesus just before the ball gets there. Again the referee waves play on, though, and a furious Fernandes takes off a boot and flings it to the turf in fury, and then goes and fetches it, and then flings it to the turf again, all of which means he ends up getting booked. 35 mins: United get a chance to break now, but Garnacha also has no support so decides to have a shot from an unlikely distance and angle, which Raya collects. 33 mins: Arsenal keep the ball for ages but can’t find a way through, over, under or past the United defence, so they play it back to Raya – and he can, with a long ball that picks out Martinelli running into space, but he’s caught up with and the ball is cleared before he can bring it under control. 30 mins: Martinez is booked, apparently for an elbow on Jesus, though Jesus goes down clutching a knee so who knows? “Don’t the rules state that an offside player CAN play the ball legally if it reaches him after a deliberate attempt by the defender to cut out the pass and deflects it?” asks Amin Sikander. Well, the law is this: A player in an offside position receiving the ball from an opponent who deliberately plays the ball, including by deliberate handball, is not considered to have gained an advantage, unless it was a deliberate save by any opponent. But a deflection is not a deliberate action, so no dice. 28 mins: Eventually the corner is taken, and Mazraoui wins the header. 27 mins: A bit of a delay while Raya gets some physio treatment, for what looks most likely to be a contact lens-related issue, ahead of an Arsenal corner. 25 mins: Arsenal are absolutely rubbish on the counter-attack. They get the chance to break and Odegaard releases Jesus on the right, but as he looks up there’s only Havertz in the middle, no other white shirts anywhere remotely useful, and a ninth defender is just dropping into position. 24 mins: United’s longest, best and pretty much only extended period of possession ends with Mainoo shooting from 22 yards or so, but without either the power or the accuracy required to beat David Raya. 20 mins: Any world in which that is onside is a horrible, unjust, miserable world. 18 mins: Arsenal have a goal disallowed! Martinelli is miles offside when the ball is played through to him, but it deflects off Maguire and Arsenal have a go at arguing that made it a new phase but the officials are having none of it and VAR is having the weekend off. 17 mins: Timber plays the ball through to Havertz, who seems to have spent most of the match in an offside position, and is there again here. 14 mins: Another Arsenal free-kick, again on the left flank but from a deeper position this time. No offside trap on this occasion, but Gabriel’s header sails wide. 11 mins: Garnacho goes for a sliding tackle on Gabriel, so poorly timed that by the time Gabriel gets anywhere near him he’s basically stopped moving. It doesn’t stop Gabriel, sniffing a yellow card, screaming loudly at what little contact there was before rolling around for a while. Andy Madley absolutely rightly gives just a free kick, and Gabriel instantly hops up again. 11 mins: For the second time already, Bayandir boots a goal kick into touch. 10 mins: Arsenal win a free-kick, from which United catch almost their entire team offside. “How are Arsenal allowed to play in shirts with no readable numbers on their backs?” demands Louise. Their shirts are spectactularly unhelpful, it must be said. They do have numbers on their backs, but only their outlines and on my screen at least they are only visible in close-up. 8 mins: Arsenal are absolutely hogging possession, but United seem to know what they’re doing in defence, starting with putting loads of people in it. 5 mins: A lovely pass from Odegaard to Jesus, running beyond the defence on the right, but the Brazilian’s cross isn’t great, and Bayindir gets an easy, early touch. 3 mins: Much of the first few minutes have been spent with Arsenal trying and failing to navigate a way through a strong United press. 2 mins: Arsenal are in the all-white kit they have worn for their last few third-round fixtures, part of their “no more red” campaign. “No More Red was launched in January 2022 to support our long-standing work to help keep young people safe from knife crime and youth violence,” the club say. “The white shirts will never be sold commercially, and instead are awarded to volunteers who give their time and skills to our charitable partners.” 1 min: Peeeeeeep! United have kicked off! This game is about to begin, under slate-grey London skies. United will kick off. A shock! Doncaster Rovers, seventh in League Two, have knocked out Championship struggler Hull on penalties, away from home, after a 1-1 draw. Spurs take a 2-0 lead, as at the Emirates Stadium the players gather in the tunnel. Pre-match reading: Ed Aarons wrote a thing about Arsenal’s approach to this season’s FA Cup: “Gentlemen whose sole ability to build up a good side depends on the payment of heavy and exhorbitant [sic] transfer fees need not apply.” This summer marks the 100th anniversary of the legendary Herbert Chapman’s appointment by Arsenal after the chairman, Sir Henry Norris, posted an advertisement in the Athletic News as they searched for a new manager. Times may have changed but the message must sound very familiar to Mikel Arteta. Much more here: “Can we put the kick off of this back half an hour to watch the spurs penalties?” asks Ian Sargeant on email. Sadly/happily/whatever Tottenham are now beating Tamworth 1-0, courtesy of an extra-time own-goal. Fifteen minutes to go there, John Brewin still typing furiously: Both teams will have half an eye on a midweek round of Premier League fixtures, and Arsenal on Wednesday’s derby against Tottenham, the third of five successive home games in all competitions. United have an extra day to prepare for the visit of Southampton. Mikel Arteta says Riccardo Califouri “had a light problem yesterday in training”, hence his absence this afternoon. “We thought about the best possible line-up, and we wanted to try and be better than Manchester United. We have a lot of games, and it is going to be an interesting week. Bearing this in mind, we believe this is the best squad to start.” John Brewin is watching the ongoing Tamworth v Tottenham tie, now with just a couple of minutes, some stoppage time and potentially extra time to play, and still 0-0! Ruben Amorim says Amad has been rested after suffering “a small issue during the week”, making this “a good opportunity to see Garnacho start”. Team news is in. United play Altay Bayindir in goal as advertised, and Alejandro Garnacho comes in for Amad Diallo. Arsenal make three changes, with Gabriel Jesus, Mikel Merino and Jorginho coming in and Leandro Trossard, Declan Rice and Thomas Partey stepping out. Arsenal: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly, Jorginho, Merino, Odegaard, Jesus, Martinelli, Havertz. Subs: Neto, Tierney, Partey, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Trossard, Sterling, Butler-Oyedeji, Rice. Manchester United: Bayindir, De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez, Mazroui, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dalot, Fernandes, Garnacho, Hojlund. Subs: Onana, Zirkzee, Malacia, Eriksen, Yoro, Amad, Casemiro, Antony, Collyer. Referee: Andrew Madley. This year’s third round has been a strange one. No replays. So few big sides away at smaller ones. Just nine games to play and the greatest upset has involved Brentford losing to a team one division below them. No2 on that list is, what, Cardiff beating Sunderland in a half-empty ground? A free draw is one of the greatest features of this great competition, but sometimes it produces a right bunch of duffers. So a game between two genuine giants, albeit giants who played each other last month and will play each other again in early March, feels like the king pole in a circus tent, holding the whole thing up. Let’s hope it’s a good one, then. Last week Manchester United, 20 times league champions, played (and, as you may remember, dramatically drew with) the team at No2 in the all-time-title list, Liverpool with 19. This week United, 13 times FA Cup champions, play the team at No1 in this all-time-title list, Arsenal with 14. They do so wanting to top up their players’ dwindling reserves of winningfeeling. \"The feeling of winning, that feeling gives you so much confidence. If you win one thing you will believe you can win more,” Ruben Amorim said on Friday. “That feeling is addictive; you feel it and it’s really easy to follow that to try to win it again. I think it is important for the confidence of the players.” Arsenal haven’t experienced winningfeeling since 2020, the last time they lifted this or indeed any trophy, and the only member of the current squad who played that day is Kieran Tierney. “I don’t expect to get credit [for that win],” Mikel Arteta said this week. “I expect to get judged on what we do on the day. And what has happened in the past, in the future, it is not relevant.” That makes today (and, sure, every other day) judgement day. The gavel is ready to fall.

Then he grew out his curls. Now Mark Zuckerberg is shifting the styling focus to his left wrist. Announcing changes on Tuesday to Facebook and Instagram’s factchecking programmes , the Meta boss wore a $900k (£740k) watch from the Swiss brand Greubel Forsey. Hand-made using white gold, only three are created each year. It joins Zuckerberg’s growing horological collection including a $1.2m rose gold timepiece from Patek Philippe and the thinnest watch ever made. But while an accessory with upwards of a six-figure price tag may be something only tech billionaires can afford, Zuckerberg is tapping in to a growing trend: the return of the mechanical wristwatch and old school digital timepiece. The trend is being fuelled by gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), many of whom have never worn a wristwatch before, typically using their smartphone to keep track of the time. A spokesperson for Depop says: “In the midst of so much uncertainty, we’re seeing a movement towards simpler, more traditional aesthetics that create a sense of nostalgia and familiarity.” The secondhand fashion platform has experienced a 34% increase in searches for watches in the past month. “In a world where most of us are glued to our phones, an analogue watch exudes a steady familiarity and classic style that blends both fashion and functionality.” When Apple launched its first smartwatch in 2015, there were claims that it would kill the entire Swiss watch industry. But as it approaches its 10th birthday, sales continue to decline as smartwatches are being shunned for old-school timepieces. On TikTok, users spotlight their favourite brands and styles spanning everything from five-figure “entry-level” Rolexes to Casio’s classic metal A168, which hovers around the £60 mark. Forty-two years after Swatch first disrupted the traditional Swiss watch market with its colourful, plastic casings and low price points, the retro brand is now being championed by hypebeasts thanks to an ongoing collaboration with Omega. During the first release of its limited edition MoonSwatch in 2022, riot police were called to manage crowds outside some stores. Its most recent drop sold out within minutes, fetching up to 20 times its original value on resale platforms. Wristwatches are also being championed on the red carpet. A luxury watch ambassador is one of the most lucrative roles in Hollywood. At the recent Golden Globes, Nicole Kidman accessorised her backless Balenciaga gown with a vintage 1920s Omega diamond-encrusted wristwatch, while Michelle Yeoh wore a chain-link style from Richard Mille. The actor Paul Mescal, known for his love of tiny shorts, has also been pictured wearing a miniuscule Cartier Tank watch measuring just 24mm x 16.55mm. Eric Macaire, executive director of global buying at the Watches of Switzerland Group, an international retailer with a brand roster including Rolex and Cartier, says its gen Z clients look for Swiss-made watches, recognised brand names and sustainability attributes. He says: “Younger people tend to be at the start of their journey into collecting watches, often making their first or second purchase and they would concentrate on sub-£5k price points.” Of course, wristwatches come heavily status-coded – and say a lot about the wearer. This is reflected in TV shows such as Industry, in which Pierpoint trader Rishi Ramdani buys a Rolex with his first compensation package. Emmanuel Macron was previously spotted removing his luxury watch during a television interview. The former British prime minister Rishi Sunak favoured vintage watches from Rolex and Chopard, while Keir Starmer wears a rubber-strap watch from Tissot. Now there are reports that even those at the very top of the chain in the City are shunning luxury brands for more humble timepieces. Warren Halliwell, content and campaign manager at Casio, says the company has experienced a massive surge in interest in the past three years. The brand, which was founded in Tokyo in 1946 and sells watches from £6, counts everyone from the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates to the rapper Tyler the Creator as fans. Halliwell says it now appeals to a cohort of gen Z who want a less obvious signifier of wealth. “They reject the idea of wearing expensive things,” says Halliwell. “They want something authentic rather than something that says I have more money than you.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/12/tick-tock-the-return-of-the-mechanical-wristwatch', 'Chloe Mac Donnell', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/33398a38ae0511c13f39d25e075c484d66a9752f/0_43_3500_2101/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 13:30:28', NULL, NULL),

Here is the latest on the LA fires: At least 16 people have been killed so far in the California fires, with 11 attributed to the Eaton Fire and five to the Palisades, while 13 other residents remain missing. Authorities issued new evacuation orders for eastern communities threatened by the Palisades fire late last night, including parts of the affluent Brentwood area. More than 100,000 people are under evacuation orders. There are reports of California residents who have lost their homes struggling to find new places to live because some landlords and businesses are illegally raising prices to a very high level. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Los Angeles are still without electricity. At least 20 arrests have been made for looting. Among them were two looters who posed as firefighters when entering houses, according to the police. Officials have imposed a mandatory curfew in evacuation zones as well as in the city of Santa Monica, which is next to Pacific Palisades. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has doubled the deployment of the state’s national guard to Los Angeles amid the wildfires. The cause of the fires, which started on Tuesday, has yet to be determined. Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response to the fires that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, Michael Traum, of the California office of emergency services, has said. As well as neighbouring countries Canada and Mexico, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon and Washington have all sent firefighters to Los Angeles as part of the emergency relief effort. The National Weather Service has warned that strong Santa Ana winds could soon return. These winds have been largely blamed for turning wildfires into the infernos that have wreaked so much destruction across large swathes of California. Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from Los Angeles, where four fires continue to rage: The Eaton fire, in the north of the city around Pasadena, covering 14,117 acres, has killed 11 people, including: Victor Shaw, 66, Anthony Mitchell, 67, who was an amputee, and his son Justin, who had cerebral palsy and was in his early 20s, Rodney Nickerson, 82, and Erliene Kelley, a retired pharmacy technician in Altadena who lived very close to Shaw and Nickerson. The Eaton Fire is the second largest and is estimated to be about 15% contained. You can read more about the people who have died since the wildfires started on Tuesday here. The Palisades fire, which is roughly 11% contained and covers 23,654 acres, has killed five people, reportedly including Randall Miod, 55, a long-time Malibu resident who died in his home, according to his mother, Australian former child actor Rory Sykes, 32, who died after his mother was unable to evacuate him, and Annette Rossilli, 85, who reportedly refused to evacuate her Pacific Palisades home after she was told to after the start of the Palisades fire. 13 other people remain missing. As we have been reporting (see post at 09.37), US president-elect, Donald Trump, has criticised California governor Gavin Newsom’s forest management policies and falsely claimed the state’s fish conservation efforts are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. He has called for the Democratic governor to resign. In 2019, during his first term as president, Trump criticised Newsom’s forest management that he said had contributed to devastating fires. Last week, he criticised the state’s water management policies in social media posts the governor and other officials dismissed as false or misleading. “One of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of America is burning down to the ground,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Posting on Truth Social six hours ago, he wrote: The fires are still raging in LA. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place. This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them? Trump, who has dismissed the climate crisis, has promised to drill for more oil and cut back on renewable energy when he returns to the White House later this month. A video shows a fire tornado spotted in the Palisades blaze: As is noted in our news report on the California wildfires, at least 20 arrests have been made for looting. Officials have imposed a mandatory curfew in evacuation zones as well as in the city of Santa Monica, which is next to Pacific Palisades. “Looting is an issue, the number of arrests is continuously growing,” Capt Mike Lorenz of the Los Angeles Police Department said yesterday. “We even made arrests of two individuals that were actually posing as firefighters coming in and out of houses,” he added. LA County Sheriff Roger Luna has said looting was “unacceptable” and hoped having soldiers – deployed in LA to crack down on looting in neighbourhoods emptied by wildfire evacuation orders – would “help send a stronger message”. Here is video of Los Angeles residents returning to their homes to assess the damaged left by the devastating fires which raged through multiple areas of the city: 34,646 homes and businesses in Los Angeles are now without electricity, according to Poweroutage.us, an outage monitor that tracks blackouts across the US. Roughly 18,400 Southern California Edison customers remain without power, as well as about 16,100 Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power customers, and about 100 with Pasadena Water and Power, according to the latest data. Here is the latest data showing the number of people without power in some of the other areas of California: San Bernardino: 8,333 Riverside: 7, 152 Santa Barbara: 2,081 In an update posted to X a few hours ago, the LA Department of Water &amp; Power said since the fires started on Tuesday they have restored power to over 355,000 customers. It’s around 2am in Los Angeles, where firefighters are continuing to battle the four fires that are ravaging the city. Sky News gave this update on these fires about an hour ago: Palisades: At least 23,654 acres, 11% contained Eaton: At least 14,117 acres, 15% contained Kenneth: At least 1,052 acres, 90% contained Hurst: At least 799 acres, 76% contained Los Angeles county board of supervisors chair Kathryn Barger has invited US president-elect, Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, to visit the region and see the devastation caused by the fires first-hand. Barger said Trump’s visit would provide hope to the local community suffering from the wildfire’s damage. “By accepting this invitation, Mr President-elect, you will join us in supporting our citizenry and thanking our heroic first responders, who have risked their own lives to save others,” Barger wrote in the letter, which has been posted on X. “We would also ask you, as our president, to stand with the people of Los Angeles County as we set our course to rebuild. Your presence would be deeply felt and appreciated.” Outgoing US President Joe Biden has already approved a disaster declaration for the southern California fires, committing the federal government to covering all of the fire management and debris removal costs for six months. In a social media post on Wednesday, Trump said California governor Gavin Newsom, who is a Democrat, had “refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water” to put out the fires. Trump has called for the California governor to resign over the fires. The governor’s press office issued a statement in response, saying: “There is no such document as the water restoration declaration – that is pure fiction.” California attorney general Rob Bonta has warned that it is illegal to engage in price gouging, looting or scamming of any kind and those who do in response to the fires will be held accountable by the law. “We’ve seen businesses and landlords … jack up the price,” he told journalists at a press conference yesterday. “It’s called price gouging. It is illegal. You cannot do it. It is a crime punishable by up to a year in jail and fines.” Prices should only be increasing 10% or less from before the fire, Bonta was quoted as having said. He said that “this is California law and it’s in place to protect those suffering from a tragedy”. The comments come amid reports of California residents who have lost their homes to the fire struggling to find new places to live due to price gouging – where companies or an individual excessively raise prices during emergencies. “We put in an application at a house … that was listed at $17,000 a month, and they told us if we didn’t pay $30,000, we weren’t going to get it. They told me they have people ready to offer more and pay cash. It’s absolutely insane,” Maya Lieberman, a 50-year-old stylist, who is unable to find anywhere to live, told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency. Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from California: A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far of the LA fires – that have already destroyed at least 12,000 structures - at between $135bn (£111bn) and $150bn (£123bn). Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Los Angeles wildfires that have destroyed 12,000 structures and killed 16 people. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades fire and 11 resulted from the Eaton fire, the coroner’s office said on Saturday evening. The Los Angeles county sheriff, Robert Luna, said the death toll is expected to rise as authorities deploy search dogs to devastated areas. The sheriff also said 13 people are reported missing. County supervisor Lindsey Horvath said the LA area “had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak, and even more Angelenos evacuated due to the north-east expansion of the Palisades fire”. The CalFire operations chief, Christian Litz, said the main focus on Saturday would be the Palisades fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus and the J Paul Getty Museum. Over the past 24 hours, the Palisades fire spread over an additional 1,000 acres (400 hectares), consuming more homes. A fierce battle against the flames was under way in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities not far from the Pacific coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. The National Weather Service warned of worsening Santa Ana winds that it predicted would pick up on Saturday night into Sunday morning in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and again on late Monday through Tuesday morning, bringing sustained winds of up to 30mph and wind gusts up to 70mph. The fire also was threatening to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. In other developments: In response to criticism over water supply issues, the LA Department of Public Works released a statement “correcting misinformation” about the lack of water to fight the Palisades fire this week. The statement was released one day after the chief of the LA fire department, Kristin Crowley, told Fox LA that her firefighters had been hamstrung when hydrants ran dry in certain parts of the Palisades on Wednesday morning. Malibu has lost one-third of the eastern edge of the city, mayor Doug Stewart said yesterday evening. He said that Malibu, a community of about 10,000 people on the western edge of Los Angeles, has suffered three fires in three months, with the Palisades fire, which threatens to spread west of interstate 405, being the worst. Firefighters deployed from Mexico arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon. Canadian and Texan firefighters are also on their way to California. Authorities issued new evacuation orders for eastern communities threatened by the Palisades fire late last night, including parts of the affluent Brentwood area. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has doubled the deployment of the state’s national guard to Los Angeles amid the wildfires. Newsom has also launched a website aimed at addressing misinformation about the Los Angeles area wildfires. CaliforniaFireFacts.com, a branch of Newsom’s own website, includes information about water availability, forest land management and LA’s fire department budget. The Southern California Edison CEO, Steven Powell, has told reporters there are now about 50,000 customers without power, “down from over half a million just a couple days ago”. Powell said there was no evidence that any of Edison’s equipment caused the Hurst fire but that the investigation was continuing.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/12/california-fires-death-toll-expected-rise-ucla-threatened-winds-latest-updates', 'Maya Yang (now) and Yohannes Lowe (earlier)', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/82cb10e03771aa6a1682c97b5a2bd82e3eeec544/0_280_4200_2520/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 13:25:16', NULL, NULL),

PC Rosie Prior and a motorist, Ryan Welford, were standing on the verge of the A19 when they and a third person were struck by a heavy goods vehicle shortly before 9am on Saturday, police said. Prior and Welford, 41, from Knaresborough, who had been involved in the first collision, both died at the scene. A teenage boy who was a passenger in Welford’s car was also struck. The child remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. North Yorkshire police said the driver of the HGV, a 65-year-old man from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He was released under investigation. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the deaths were a “profound tragedy”. She added: “This brave officer’s passing serves as a reminder of the risks that our dedicated police officers face every single day in the line of duty”. Tim Forber, the chief constable of North Yorkshire police, said Prior joined the force more than two years ago because “she wanted to help people” and that she “epitomises the very best of British policing”. In a statement outside Fulford Road police station on Sunday, Forber said his colleague had been off duty when she came across a collision on the A19 and had stopped to help. He said: “She got out and like many police officers up and down the country put herself on duty. “And it was whilst dealing with that incident that she was tragically killed. Rosie epitomises the very best of British policing, she put the safety of others before her own safety.” He said his thoughts were with Welford’s family, and that it was a “deeply traumatic and heartbreaking event for everyone involved”. David Skaith, the mayor of York and North Yorkshire, and Jo Coles, the deputy mayor of policing, fire and crime, said their “hearts are broken” for the families of those killed. They said in joint statement: “Rosie’s commitment to serving the public, even when off duty, shows she was the very best of us. “Our thoughts are also with the entire North Yorkshire police family, who we know will be deeply mourning their colleague. We especially want to thank officers and staff who worked at the scene and are supporting those affected by this tragedy. “This remains a live investigation, with a member of the public still in a serious condition in hospital. “We echo the chief constable’s request that these families are given privacy to grieve. We will remain in close contact with North Yorkshire police to offer them any and all support.” Her family said the “loving mum, wife, daughter, sister, aunty” would be “deeply missed”. In a statement to North Yorkshire police, Welford’s family said: “Ryan was a hardworking and loving father, husband, son and brother. He will be greatly missed by his family and friends.” The scene of the collision reopened at about 7.20pm on Saturday. Two cars and the lorry were removed and the surrounding roads cleared of debris. Police called for witnesses and motorists with relevant dashcam footage to come forward. As tributes were paid by police forces across the country, the national body that represents frontline officers issued its “deepest condolences” to the families of Prior and Welford. Tiff Lynch, the acting chair of the Police Federation of England &amp; Wales, said: “It is with immense grief and sorrow that the Police Federation of England and Wales offers its deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the two persons, including PC Rosie Prior, who were killed in a tragic collision on A19. “We are assisting North Yorkshire Police Federation in offering every possible support to PC Prior’s loved ones.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/12/tributes-paid-to-yorkshire-police-officer-rosie-prior-ryan-welford-killed-at-crash-scene', 'Josh Halliday North of England editor', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/091c35fbf914de28e436deceff83144513bda5fa/0_1700_4252_2549/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 13:21:02', NULL, NULL);

Jas Singh: “We have to be proud, that was the scrappiest goal that’s ever been scored. They didn’t fancy it as long as the game went on, and had to bring on the big boys.” The Tamworth players are taking their deserved plaudits. They’ve been the heroes. Heartbreak and tired legs for Tamworth. Now begin the cliches of the part-timers going back to work. They deserve full credit for taking the superstars to extra time. It ends up a fruitful week for Ange, having beaten Liverpool and escaped this. He may not wish to rewatch his team’s performance in normal time. Though for that, much of the credit belongs to Tamworth. At least he didn’t celebrate. Djed Spence’s cross finds Morrison, who trips on the ball. Johnson’s finish is good and true. 114 min: Kari Tulinius joins us: “I’m sure the focus will be on Spurs being below par, but Tamworth’s players have perfomed excellently. I’d say that by the end of regulation, they looked likelier to score.” Agreed. Haydn Hollis, who has been excellent, is being mocked by the Spurs fans. Great banter. You know the type. They get off the train, and sing “Tamworth’s a ****hole, I wanna go home.” That’s Tamworth, reasonably well-appointed market town. King Offa liked it: The King of Mercia built a palace in Tamworth that was considered a “wonder of the age”. He also fortified the town with a wall and ditch. 112 min: Ange will be relieved. It did feel like a job on the line moment. He must now hope for a good draw. The game, since you didn’t ask, is tired Tamworth legs chasing down Tottenham. What we expected but took such a long time to happen. 110 min: This game is killed as contest now, when Tamworth could be celebrating the extra pay day, and getting the use of the cushioned head rests of the Tottenham Stadium dressing room. Tamworth have been magnificent, whereas the goons who run the game continue to make decisions that look after the gilded elite while passing none of the loot down the trapdoors. 108 min: Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: “I’m with Aaron Bowater there, scrapping replays was ridiculous, given that the big clubs have enough tools at their disposal to fight on many fronts. Maybe it’s to help smooth the path and clear some ££££ fixture congestion ready for the “joy” of the much-loved ESL ? The magic of the Cup, eh?” That added Champions League schedule killed the magic of the Cup…sigh. Ball from Son, through the gap and the Swede clatters home. That was too easy, and wasn’t possible during the 90. The semi-pros have, understandably, flagged. 106 min: We are back on, and Tamworth look tired. Just a minute added on. There wasn’t much of a celebration of the goal. Embarrassment curbed that. So, just 15 minutes left for the Lambs to write their name in history. 104 min: Spurs are in damage limitation mode here. This has been horrible for them, even though they will escape into the fourth round in all likelihood. Tamworth fancy a penalty as Djed Spence crashes into Wreh, It wasn’t much of a foul. 101 min: To say that goal was scrappy would the understatement of the decade. Porro did well. The rest was crap 90s football in essence. A real passion killer. Porro fancies one from distance. Or does he? Johnson gets it short, and then Bergvall and Solanke both swing and miss and it ends up being an own-goal from the sub. 99 min: Bergvall seems to collide with Nathan Muya Tshikuna, then Son is fouled. Tamworth fans plead refereeing conspiracy. 97 min: Richard Hirst rewinds to the days of America’s blonde bombshell Peter Mellor: “The ending of replays has had one small positive outcome. Fulham may not have much in the trophy cabinet but we will forever be the answer to the quiz question ‘which team took the most games to reach the FA Cup Final?’.” 96 min: Stephen Grundy is here all week: “I was just walking past the Lamb Ground and simply couldn’t believe my luck. A disgruntled Spurs fan had actually nailed his season ticket to a tree! I obviously grabbed it and stuffed it in my pocket. You can never have enough nails... can ya?” 95 min: Son’s corner whips past everyone. Tamworth under the gun for the first time. That 90 minutes didn’t feature much concerted pressure. 94 min: Spurs stepping it up with all those superstars now frontloaded into the team. A voice from the crowd is heard. “Solanke, why are you so wanky?” Terrace wit endures at the Lamb. 92 min: AD gets in touch. “Ange isn’t good enough. Found out time and again. Whatever the final score, this has been appalling from the Tottenham. Almost Sherwood level bad.” Sherwood level? Ouch? (I actually enjoyed Tim at Tottenham. Fun times.) 91 min: Three Tottenham changes: Son, Spence, Kulusevski on: off Dragusin, Maddison, Werner. Maddison had rather been lost on the fringes of the competition. Tom on Chris Wreh senior: “Christopher Wreh was an odd one. Most of the time he looked like he’d struggle to get into the Tamworth side (especially this one) but for a six week period in the spring of 1998 he filled in for Dennis Bergkamp and we barely noticed, helping us get over the line in both league and cup. Hoping his son enhances the Wreh legend today.” I am corrected by the Guardian’s night editor, Richard Preston: “Get with the times John - they’ve been Bromsgrove Sporting since the phoenix rose from the ashes in 2009!” Aaron Bowater makes a most salient point: “As an Addick who suffered through being taken to a replay by the Cray Valley Papermills last year (and well played to them- it got decidedly hairy at points), when is somebody at the FA going to be held responsible for the vandalism of getting shot of replays? Tamworth have more than earned their night in North London.” And it’s Tottenham who were hanging on. Tamworth so very nearly scored. Jordan Cullinane-Liburd will have nightmare that he scuffed that volley. Oh my. The Magic of the Cup of Dreams! 90+6 min: Wreh wins a foul. The ball will be launched. Solanke slips and the chance opens up, and McGlinchey has a shot. From the corner, the chance falls to Tamworth. A simple volley into the hands of Kinsky. Oh no! That was the one. And that’s the end of the 90. 90+4 min: Extra time seems nailed on. Spurs don’t look interested enough. 90+3 min: The Tamworth fans sing: “no-one likes us.” Is this so? Hated by Telford, Kidderminster, Worcester City, Bromsgrove Rovers? 90+1 min: Who wants this more? Guts or glory? A miracle or shame? 90 min: Spurs appear incapable of putting an attack together. Werner is hesitant, and Wreh concedes a foul when Tamworth might have had an attack. Six minutes have been added on. 88 min: Ange looks disgruntled, to say the least. His team have been poor. 86 min: Wreh makes an instant impact, and sends Williams away. Tamworth want this done in the 90. 84 min: Tamworth’s assistant boss is booked for dissent. This is getting heated. Off goes Tonks, and on comes Wreh, son of Christopher Wreh, Gunners legend. 81 min: Williams makes an early dart, but Bissouma squeezes him down. Dragusin pulls down Creaney, and Tonks is booked for asking for a booking. It would have been the Romanian’s second. 80 min: Tamworth now withdrawn into the traditional lines of Torres Vedras to try and reach extra time. Enoru is off, and on comes Williams for Tottenham. 79 min: Porro’s shot deflects back out, though finds no takers. 78 min: Tottenham push on, and in numbers. They don’t want extra time, with a midweek game coming up. 76 min: Porro booked for crashing into Enoru. Fair cop, too. 75 min: Ange is in the muttering to himself stage, especially as the ball bounces off Tonks and almost deflects in. Everyone living on their nerves right now. 73 min: Tottenham have made heavy weather of this. Munashe Sundire replacing Callum Cockerill-Mollett is Tamworth’s change so far. 71 min: The misses are beginning to stack up. Reguillon, across to Johnson, and he can’t get around it. 70 min: Kieren McKintosh gets in touch: “Wondering if, in a hospital in North London somewhere, Van de Ven is watching this on TV and shaking his head ruefully at how holey Tottenhams defence are being right now. “Mind you, at least he’ll have a squad of his own with the injuries spurs have. They could ask for a replay, but Tamworth v Tottenham Injured doesn’t have the same ring to it.” 68 min: Ange rolls the dice: Solanke and Bergvall on, and off go Moore and Sarr. 67 min: Oh, what a chance for Tamworth! The corner comes in and Cullinane-Liburd heads down, and just wide. Did it come off Bissouma? It goes just wide. 66 min: Jeremy Boyce has invoked the ArchDrude: “Just walked back in from a nice weekend in the hills (south of France) and joined your MBM. Is the “Mayor” present? Of course I’m talking about pop-punk psychedelic genius Julian Cope of course, the unofficial/self appointed “Mayor of Tamworth”. I’m sure the ground is already bouncing, maybe some of this will help get their team over the line....” Mrs Cope, she once told me on Twitter, is a Spurs fan, so who knows? 65 min: Timo Werner – set clear by Johnson – surely must score. But then again, he is Timo Werner and Jas Singh makes a fine sliding save, a painful one on 3g. 64 min: Tonks on the charge, but held off by Bissouma. 62 min: Ange looks nervous, and well he might. Him and his 14 extra staff members, all sat in a row, could be on the end of a Cup classic here. They’ve offered little beyond Mikey Moore, who’s started to be an influence. 60 min: Yellows for both Dragusin and Creaney for extended shoving. Kinsky eventually clears the ball. 59 min: A Tonks special causes all kinds of ructions in the Spurs box. The ball won’t quite drop for anything better than a half-chance. Dragusin meanwhile is down. 58 min: Paul Moody gets in touch: “Remembering the Hereford, Radford goal in the mud, and MUFC defeats in cup finals. Innocent times. Now in n.e. Brasil, 32 degrees. Warm. Hot.” 57 min: Tamworth attack. They are not just yet sitting back and hoping for penalties. This is a well-coached unit. 55 min: Tottenham have their best chance yet. Moore header is goalward but knocked off the line. It was Hollis again. What a game he’s having. 54 min: Olé! Hollis just pulled off a piece of Zidane-style skill in coming out of defence and shaking off two attackers. Like Laurent Blanc with a suedehead. 52 min: Porro goes down from a Creaney tackle. Was the Tamworth attacker anywhere near him? 50 min: Archie Gray sidles up from defence. Tamworth aren’t engaging much of a high press. More a high regress, sat back, asking Tottenham to supply some magic. And it’s not happening at all just yet. 48 min: Jas Singh, who became a father last night, has hurt himself making a save from Maddison. He takes a while to recover but looks OK to continue. 47 min: Ian Copestake: “If it keeps doing this well against Spurs and shows Liverpool how to do it this performance might go down in history as a Tamworth manifesto.” John Wright: ”Artificial slope with real snow. Must be the slope that’s artificial, done with mirrors?” Rob Farley: “As an Arsenal fan I’d love to see Chris Wreh come on and score the winner over Tottenham, after his dad got us to the FA Cup legend back in 1998.” Padraig: “Tamworth have a zipper salesman in their line-up. Let’s hope Spurs don’t get caught with their flies open.” Nigel: “Your “slaughtered by the lambs” comment reminds me of “Sheep” from Pink Floyd’s Animals. Poor Angie.” Richard Hirst: “It should be no surprise that Tamworth are doing well; their name is clearly the product of running together and shortening the names of famously feisty US senator Tammy Duckworth. Maybe once they’ve seen off Spurs they should sort out Donald Trump?” 46 min: No changes. Just like Wembley, the corporates are slow to return to their seats. Back out at the Lamb. Does it lie down on Broadway? Tamworth have done exactly what they wanted to do, barring create a threat. That can come later, to squeeze the margin for error for Tottenham, who have been poor, distracted and, if they are not too careful, might end up being slaughtered by the lambs. 45 min: Just a minute added. It’s been real, and too real for Tottenham. Porro forces a corner. He takes it himself but as soon as it’s cleared the half-time whistle sounds. 43 min: Ben Crompton has done well as full-back. Tamworth, as a unit, have been excellent. If they can their one chance, then who knows? 41 min: Porro concedes a throw. And we now know what that means. Hollis at the back post is the target and might have done better. Spurs look panicked by this not-so secret weapon. 39 min: Dragusin and Kinsky get in a mess, and the goalie has to hack clear. He’s had a couple of shaky moments, mostly not of his own doing. 37 min: Tamworth have been robust and organised. A few reducers going in, and with no VAR, it’s a gamble worth taking. Tottenham have played far worse than they did against Liverpool in midweek. 35 min: Tamworth corner. Pushing and shoving in the Spurs box. Kinsky looks safe as he collects the ball. 33 min: Maddison takes a cruncher from McGlinchey but Spurs keep the ball. Johnson sets Porro on the overlap but the ball zips off out, and possibly near the ley lines for which Tamworth is known. 32 min: Nice skill from Maddison, cutting beyond Milnes and Singh makes a decent save. Sarr then forces another corner. 30 min: Now it’s Tottenham’s turn for a set piece. Maddison’s kick can’t beat the first man. The ball comes out to Werner. Shot blocked, and Porro gets snuffed, too. It’s not happening for Ange’s men; they have been slow. 28 min: Here comes one of those Tonks. This time, it’s knocked away. Enoru’s back on but looking discomforted. A shame. 26 min: Enoru, who produced that attack in the first minute, pulls up, having stood on the ball. A hamstring twang? Could well be. Or just a jar. 24 min: Edan Tal: “Is Tamworth’s Tonks one of football’s few onomatopoeic footballers? Don’t think Gary Speed was fast enough to count.” Tottenham being thoroughly jeered. It’s all good fun. 22 min: Eric Dunn gets in touch: “As you can see from the drone photo of The Lamb accompanying your MBM report, Tamworth have an indoor training facility adjacent to the ground called SnowWorld (artificial ski slope with “real” snow). Surely there’s got to be some humour to be extracted from that. Can’t think of anything myself atm, but then again, I’m only just risen from the scratcher, and yet to partake of any liquid refreshment. Enjoy the match ... it’s games like this that make the whole FA Cup circus so worthwhile.” Tottenham continue to pass the ball around to the accompaniment of boos. 21 min: Paul Roche also get in touch: “Hi John. Timo Werner education us today. Never knew that. I wonder is that the same in Spain. Perhaps they should introduce that in England. Would have given Accrington the chance to host liverpool, Morecombe Chelsea and Manchester United - Arsenal.” Timo himself shows a lovely piece of control but fails to find Maddison. 20 min: Gill Kirkby gets in touch: “I was at Anfield yesterday (with no signal, no 3G pitch you see) and the Stanley fans were singing a tribute to Fields of Anfield Road, “Fields of Accrington”. Really hope the Tamworth faithful have rewritten some Spurs anthems, perhaps with reference to the legendary Tamworth two?” Per wiki: “The Tamworth Two were a pair of pigs that escaped while being unloaded from a lorry at an abattoir in the English town of Malmesbury, Wiltshire in January 1998. The pigs (later named Butch and Sundance after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) were on the run for more than a week, and the search for them caused a huge media sensation, as well as immense public interest, both in Britain and abroad.” 19 min: Kinsky does ever so well in claiming the catch from the throw. He looks the part: so far. 18 min: Oof, shot from McGlinchey, and the ball comes off Archie Gray and behind. A corner, rather than a throw. 16 min: Jeers as Maddison makes time and space to shoot and can only thwack it wide. 14 min: Ever-vigilant Liverpool fans would like me to point out that their team was beaten in the Carabao Cup and it was only the first leg. So there. 13 min: Well, that Tonks throw is some weapon. Kinsky is left exposed as it missiles into the box and the ball comes loose, and bounces off the post and out. To Tottenham relief. 11 min: Kieren gets in touch: “Today has a distinct “anything could happen” magic to it, and not just because Spurs won their last match. Nearly dropped my phone at the tip yesterday when Plymouth won. They say lightning doesn’t strike twice, but after Tamworth went straight down and forced Kinsky to save, you never know... “In other news, on Boxing Day I mentioned in the Newcastle v Ipswich ‘clocko’ a girl in my lectures I hoped to ask out. Well, from the looks of things she’s just broken up with her boyfriend. Like I said, anything can happen...” 10 min: Some high-grade booing from the Tamworth locals. Not had a “you what, you what, you what” yet. Answer: “you heard, you heard you heard, you heard.” See also the “woaaaaah” roar for Kinsky’s kicking. 8 min: Spurs dominating possession, going down the slope. Maddison gets turn to spin and shoot. 7 min: Maddison sends Sarr away. Werner and Moore find Brennan Johnson, and it’s a poor effort. A 3g bobble? 5 min: Spurs settle into possession, using the 3g, which looks a tad patchy. Isn’t that when your phone goes to “E” and you know you’re getting nowt. 3 min: Corner forced after Porro finds Reguillon. Maddison takes, and Jas Sing the goalie makes a fine save, and that’s followed by a quick break. The result is a throw and Tom Tonks will launch this one. It’s cleared. 1 min: And the first shot is from Tamworth, whose left winger bursts down the edge of the box and forces a save from Kinsky. The attacker’s name? Beck-Ray Besongbap Enoru, he’s from Cameroon. Ange is giving it back to the hoons, and laughing away. In the goal net, the Tamworth goalie and their tallest defender are glueing back on the net. Oh, this is glorious stuff. All we need is Jimmy Hill to come on and run the line. The goal nets look to have been tampered with. Behind Ange, a load of bloody hoons, to quote Alf Stewart, are making a nuisance of themselves, giving it the big one. The teams take to the field. It looks brass monkeys in Tamworth. James Maddison is carrying out the team talk in the Tottenham huddle. It’s cramped in the tunnel, and Ange Postecoglou looks determined. The 3g pitch beckons. Bob Andrews, the Tamworth chairman, has spoken to the BBC: “It is the biggest day in the club’s history. We thought Wembley was good in the FA Vase but this tops it. To have a Premier League club of this stature at Tamworth is fantastic. It is just nice to get all the crowd here. I wish we could get more in but we are full to capacity. “The money from this game is going to help us develop the ground itself. We need better dressing rooms, we need a stand down the bottom end - we need various things. It’s tidy but it needs upgrading.” So, how were the changing rooms? Timo Werner seems chipper enough as he states that in Germany, the smaller team always hosts the cup tie. Tamworth: Singh, Crompton, Cullinane-Liburd, Hollis, Cockerill-Mollett, Tonks, Milnes, McLinchey, Morrison, Enoru, Creaney. Subs: Phillips, Curley, Digie, Fletcher, Finn, Wreh, Williams, Tshikuna, Sundire. Reguilon, Sarr, Maddison, Johnson, Werner, Moore in, Djed Spence, Son, Solanke, Kulusevski and Bergval out, with Bentancur on the sidelines, too. Kinsky continues in goal. Tottenham: Kinsky, Porro, Dragusin, Gray, Reguilon, Sarr, Bissouma, Maddison, Johnson, Werner, Moore. Subs: Austin, Spence, Dorrington, Bergvall, Olusesi, Kulusevski, Son, Solanke, Lankshear. Here’s Ben Fisher’s excellent story on Tamworth FC. Nickname: The lambs. To the slaughter? Let’s see. Tamworth, a busy, proud market town in the west Midlands, full of history, its best known son the arch-drude Julian Cope, hosts the mighty Tottenham. They’re 16th in the National League so play a decent standard of football, so can Ange’s boys have it all their own way. After that tough night in beating Liverpool in the FA Cup, a thin squad will be rotated. This is the tie of the round for those who like to see the minnows host the elite.

The hosts finally saw their resistance broken after 100 minutes via a scrappy own goal, the ball coming off the knee of Nathan Tshikuna amid a bundle of bodies in the Tamworth box. The late blow was compounded in the second half of extra time when Son Heung-min fed Dejan Kulusevski, whose clinical finish doubled Spurs’ lead. Brennan Johnson’s strike finished things off shortly after, the final scoreline not doing justice to the hosts’ efforts. Before that, the side 16th in the National League had given their Premier League opponents plenty to think about in normal time. Tamworth were resilient without posing a major threat in the first half.

(95, 'uk-news/2025/jan/12/deep-joy-wales-embraces-hwyl-in-tourism-campaign-to-rival-danish-hygge', 'Deep joy: Wales embraces ‘hwyl’ in tourism campaign to rival Danish ‘hygge’', 'The Guardian', 'UK news', '‘Hwyl can raise the heartbeat or relax the body; it’s your own particular form of happiness,’ says Welsh psychologist', 'The Danish word hygge, which summons a feeling of cosy, fire-crackling contentedness, has done its fair share for tourism in Scandinavia as well as sparking a string of self-help guides. Now Visit Wales is aiming to draw tourists to its hills, valleys, coastlines and cities by harnessing the lovely Welsh word hwyl, which it defines as a “deep state of joy that comes from being totally immersed in the moment”, in its 2025 publicity drive. Visit Wales says hwyl can be found in places and scenarios that mean most to those taking part, whether it be exploring a forest, gazing at stars, surfing or attending a music festival. Pinning a PR campaign to a word can be troublesome. VisitScotland once used the Scottish Gaelic word còsagach to try to convey a feeling of snugness, but some speakers pointed out it meant “a wee nook or hole” such as a small creature might live in – not quite the vibe they were going for. Rhys Iorwerth, a poet and translator from Caernarfon, north Wales, told the Guardian Visit Wales’s initiative could be a winner because the word (pronounced something like “hoo-eel”, though it depends on a speaker’s accent or dialect) could fit so many scenarios. He said: “The beauty of the word is that it can mean various things. It’s commonly used as a noun to convey joy, fun or merriment. But it can also mean one’s frame of mind, disposition or spirit. “For instance, if you ask someone about their hwyliau – hwyliau is the plural of hwyl – you’re asking them in which mood they’re in. Or alternatively, hwyl can mean one’s journey, course or progress. It’s a wonderfully agile word.” Awel Vaughan-Evans, of the school of psychology at Bangor University in north Wales, said: “Hwyl comes to life in both relaxing and energetic environments. On one hand, hwyl can release dopamine, fire neurotransmitters and raise the heartbeat, creating a prolonged sense of euphoria. Alternatively, it can slow it right down with endorphins reducing stress, causing the entire body to relax. Essentially, hwyl is your own particular form of happiness.” Andrew Hawke, of the University of Wales Dictionary (Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru) said: “The history of ‘hwyl’ is rather difficult. The basic meaning of the word is ‘a sail’ and it is first recorded in a list of names of letters in the so-called Alphabet of Nemnius from the 9th century – although the meaning of the word in that example is not known. “It is evidently an old word, and has a cognate in Old Irish séol, which also originally meant ‘a sail’ and developed further meanings over time. It is not certain where these words came from, but they may well have been borrowed from one or more of the Germanic languages, which is where ‘sail’ in English also comes from. “It is of course nonsense to say that the word in untranslatable, but it does have a wide range of meanings. It is also used as an informal farewell, ‘Hwyl’, or ‘Hwyl fawr.’” Also on board the campaign is Maxine Hughes, a US-based Welsh broadcaster who has worked with Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney on the show Welcome to Wrexham. She said: “We’ve got a deep appreciation for the outdoors and having fun here, whether it’s warm or wet, dry or cold. Our landscape and willingness to embrace the outdoors is part of the beauty of hwyl.” The hwyl campaign is being launched on Monday to coincide with Hen Galan, a new year celebration marked by residents of a wooded valley in south-west Wales, Cwm Gwaun. For this event, at least, the residents still work by the old Julian calendar. Delme Harries, a Pembrokeshire county councillor who represents the area, said: “Hwyl is a very positive, feelgood word.” He said the people of Cwm Gwaun would certainly “have hwyl” on their New Year’s Day. More cosy lifestyle words Hygge Beaten by “Brexit” as the word of 2016, the Danish word hygge is a cosy feeling of wellbeing. It led to a slew of books, such as The Little Book of Hygge by Meik Wiking of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen. Còsagach VisitScotland came up with its version of hygge, but some experts felt it didn’t quite work, summoning up images of a mossy nook rather than a place a tourist would really like to stay. Lagom Inevitably, the success of hygge led to a search for other lifestyle words from Scandinavia. Lagom, a Swedish word meaning something like “everything in moderation”, or just enough, fitted the bill but did not have the longevity of hygge. Ikigai The Japanese word ikigai also had a moment. It can be translated as “a reason for being” – something that gets you out of bed. Finding your ikigai is felt to be crucial to longevity.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/12/deep-joy-wales-embraces-hwyl-in-tourism-campaign-to-rival-danish-hygge', 'Steven Morris', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/be5e9700b36935305f0089d61fa3085dd59b93c7/0_163_5616_3370/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 13:00:36', NULL, NULL),

Nestled on the top floor of a 1930s Parisian apartment building, his compact 78 sqm home, fondly referred to as the chambre du bonne in Parisian housing circles, is the maid’s quarters in the attic. Payet wanted to create a “contemporary and colourful cabin” based on his childhood love of tree houses. Situated on a quiet street in the east of the city, in Neuilly-Plaisance, he lives with his daughters, Mila, 11 and Liv, seven, who share one of the two bedrooms, which he styled in pink and yellow. “Colour for me, is my way of expressing myself,” says Payet. “It’s my inspiration, the way for me to differentiate myself with my vision, and this is 100% my own universe.” His Hay Quilton sofa, a popping emerald green, designed by London studio Doshi Levien, was the foundation and inspiration for the rest of the interiors. “I found the sofa before I even began this project. I was completely obsessed with this vibrant green, so I decided to integrate it as much as possible.” Notes of this fresh grassy tone are reflected inside the arches that Payet built into the walls of the open-plan kitchen, dining and living space, it glides along the skirting and is picked up around the door frames, integrated arched window and even in his choice of the lighting, plates and vases. “Absolutely every feature was dragging the place down – we had to demolish it all. And this was the chance to create a sort of laboratory, experimenting with new combinations of materials and colours,” explains Payet, who pulled up two layers of tiles that had hidden and almost destroyed the original pine floor. He also removed a partition between the kitchen and living room, added a new wall to separate the two bedrooms, but kept historical details, such as the wooden beams. Key to working with a small home is to create bespoke storage, which is what Payet did under the eaves in order to maximise the space. The kitchen island has integrated storage and was designed to fit under the low ceilings and wooden beams. A glass, internal and south-facing window was fashioned into the wall between the dining and master bedroom to encourage more light in. Despite strictly enforced rules around having real fires in the city of lights, Payet’s dream was to have a fireplace. He got around the problem by installing a bioethanol tank and chimney. An environmentally clean solution, it provided him with both a cosy hearth to sit by and another opportunity to introduce more joyful tones; he chose glossy amber tiles designed by Sebastian Herkner to clad the chimney. A subdued olive-green paint is used in the master bedroom, covering the mango-wood headboard and sweeping around the room to cover its lower half, engineering a defined working space for Payet’s desk by breaking the wall into two different colours. “I like to attribute a colour to a room or a function, to help the eye quickly understand the space configuration,” says Payet. Behind the headboard, his primary passion continues with a crisp cobalt blue. Clever built-in niche details beside the beds and in the bathroom offer additional storing space. A 1950s baby-blue shade is the hero in the kitchen and on the walls of the living room. A Margaux Keller-designed wool rug further enhances the 50s palette, on top of which sits a lacquered ice-cream pink coffee table, a collaboration between Made, and UK designers 2LG, whose colourful work is an inspiration for Payet, who studied graphical art and worked as a fashion designer for many years before moving into the world of interiors. Travel, says Payet, is his main inspiration: “I wanted a masculine palette in my bedroom with khaki and blue, this sky-blue is a little bit of my signature style, it brings a travel mood instantly, like being in Greece or Morocco.” A terracotta tadelakt effect is used in the bathroom, inspired by his travels to Morocco; the walls and the built-in cubby holes are coated with Tuscan-coloured waxed concrete. Stripy terracotta and white tiles pull the two sides of the room together and frame the double sinks. “It might seem strange but compartmentalising enlarges spaces. The mistake would be to think that you must have an open space, that is the worst idea. Breaking up a space brings an easy reading of the functions.” Describing his style as “colourful timelessness”, Payet is experienced in transforming small Parisian apartments into stylish working homes. He begins by defining the practical needs, how many people, where are the windows which catch the maximum light? What spaces are needed to sleep, eat, shower, and cook? “I always consider the practical before the decorative aspect and I think working with constraints only multiplies the imagination.” marn-deco.com', 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/12/true-colours-this-paris-apartment-is-an-exercise-in-vibrant-self-expression', 'Hannah Newton', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/8b505604904abc3d8c81c63e9cdc3c23b9d887be/0_89_5788_3473/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 13:00:35', NULL, NULL),
(97, 'books/2025/jan/12/lgbtq-rights-american-revolution', '‘More complicated than we think’: the untold story of LGBTQ+ rights in the American Revolution', 'The Guardian', 'Books', 'Gay historian John McCurdy uncovers the little-known tale of Robert Newburgh – a British army chaplain accused of homosexuality – in new book Vicious and Immoral', 'Individual rights are synonymous with the American Revolution. While many of the debates that built up to the revolution centered around taxes, a little-known legal controversy from the era suggests that the crown and colonists also differed when it came to LGBTQ+ rights. Serving with the 18th Regiment of Foot in Philadelphia, the British army chaplain Robert Newburgh was accused of having had sexual relations with a man – or as it was known at the time, buggery. Viewing his standing within the regiment as undermined, Newburgh sought recourse in a variety of court cases culminating with a court martial in 1774 – the year before the revolution. Almost two and a half centuries later, the Eastern Michigan University history professor John McCurdy came across the story and saw parallels between Newburgh’s defense of his rights and the colonists’ standing up for theirs. To McCurdy, it was a chance to illuminate a rarely documented LGBTQ+ narrative within the revolutionary period, in his new book, Vicious and Immoral: Homosexuality, the American Revolution, and the Trials of Robert Newburgh. “The American Revolution is a much more complicated process than we think,” McCurdy says. “The experience of the American Revolution is … a lot more diverse,” including with regard to women, Black people, Native Americans – and LGBTQ+ individuals. McCurdy calls his book “a way to think about people who are very much a part of our culture and country. What is their story in the revolution? What promises and possibilities did the revolution hold for men like Robert Newburgh?” With the Trump administration about to return to office, McCurdy addressed the relevance his book might have for the upcoming political moment in America. “I think [Trump] always defies expectations on LGBTQ+ issues,” McCurdy says. “His treasury secretary designate is an openly gay man … he would be the highest-ranking homosexual in the capital at that point. At the same time, of course, Trump and some of his partners have engaged in some really nasty homophobia. This is a contradiction that’s always been there with different people and different opinions.” A revolutionary war scholar, McCurdy is himself a gay man. “I have long wanted to write a book about homosexuality, especially in this era,” McCurdy says, calling Newburgh’s case “a real find” and adding: “There was no way I could write a book about homosexuality in the American Revolution and not come out in the introduction.” Of his identity, he says: “I don’t think it colors my perception of the case. I tried to be as honest as possible and not claim anything that I can’t back up in the documents.” The book is a window into differing perceptions of homosexuality across the Atlantic in the 18th century. “With homosexuality in Britain and the US”. McCurdy says, “after 1780, the British were much more acute and punitive. Laws increased, executions increased … in the colonies, a lot of people looked the other way. “I’m not saying it was OK to be gay [in the colonies] in the 18th century,” McCurdy adds. “But there was an interest in not asking too many questions.” Newburgh, who never married or had children, grew up in a well-to-do Protestant family in Ireland. Graduating from Trinity College, he was well-versed in literature and an accomplished horseback rider. He embarked upon a career in the Anglican priesthood. Yet he was dogged by accusations of having sex with a male servant who was also his foster brother. During a monthlong stay in Sligo, they allegedly slept in the same bed. According to the book, they had done so since Newburgh’s childhood, but it was a common practice and Newburgh also cited his chronic illness as a reason. Even as Newburgh successfully applied for a chaplaincy in the British army, the accusations lingered. One who knew of them was his countryman Thomas Batt, a former officer in the 18th, which was nicknamed the Royal Irish. When Batt learned who would be the new chaplain of the regiment, he sent a condemnatory letter to Newburgh. Batt got to Philadelphia ahead of Newburgh, set up a liquor store and alerted the regiment’s captains. Soon the chaplain felt that he had become the target of disrespect, including jokes at his expense. His attempts to clear his name triggered multiple legal cases and divided the regiment. The captains were almost unanimous in their opposition to Newburgh, while lower-ranking officers tended to support the chaplain. There was also a divide in how they felt about the patriot cause. The captains opposing Newburgh stayed faithful British soldiers during the revolution, while the junior officers deserted to the patriots and remained in the colonies post-independence. One enlisted man’s stance changed over time: Pte Nicholas Gaffney. He had quarreled with his superior, Capt John Shee, and pursued legal recourse. The subsequent court martial initially went badly for Gaffney – until his tactics changed mid-proceedings. Shee – correctly – saw in this the hand of Newburgh. The chaplain ultimately masterminded Gaffney’s case behind the scenes, to no avail. The private was sentenced to 1,000 lashes, a punishment halted at 600 due to fears over its harshness. Gaffney turned against his benefactor, through testimony in a court martial of Newburgh that the chaplain had called at his own request, seeking to clear his reputation. As the book details, Newburgh stumbled over representing himself – until it was time for the closing arguments. He invoked soaring ideals of the Enlightenment, which had challenged the divine right of kings with a call for individual liberties. The verdict was a mixed bag – Newburgh was guilty of some charges, acquitted of others, and received a six-month suspension without pay. Litigious to the last minute, he made appeals, including to Gen Gage, and finally had his sentence commuted after three months. By this time, members of the Royal Irish were passing through New Jersey and New York en route to the hotbed of Massachusetts; some would fight and die in the early battles of the revolution.

Director Magnus von Horn, whose previous film was the equally impressive Sweat, about an unravelling fitness influencer, frequently lights actors from beneath. A deliberately unflattering approach borrowed from horror cinema, it turns faces into grotesque gargoyles, strips them of softness and humanity and highlights the animalistic savagery. Nowhere is this more evident than in Sonne’s phenomenal, feral performance. Karoline is a pitiable victim certainly, but she is also a sly and opportunistic emotional scavenger with a capacity for cruelty. It’s a remarkable film: bleak, but horribly compelling.

In an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper in Italy, excerpts of which were published this weekend by Breitbart, Bannon criticised Musk’s embrace of some forms of immigration and vowed to ensure that Musk does not have top-level access to the White House. “He is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down,” Bannon said. “Before, because he put money in, I was prepared to tolerate it – I’m not prepared to tolerate it any more.” He added: “I will have Elon Musk run out of here by inauguration day”, which falls on 20 January. “He will not have full access to the White House. He will be like any other person.” Musk became one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders, and certainly his richest, during the Republican’s ultimately successful campaign to regain the US presidency, spending reportedly about $270m and being rewarded with a place at Trump’s side ever since. After his victory Trump tapped Musk to help lead an advisory group theoretically dedicated to cutting US government spending by up to $2tn, a quarter of its entire budget. But Musk’s embrace of H-1B visas, which allow companies – such as Musk’s own SpaceX and Tesla – to hire skilled professionals and engineers from outside the US, has been taken badly by other Maga acolytes who are opposed to nearly all forms of immigration. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has himself held an H1-B visa. “This thing of the H-1B visas, it’s about the entire immigration system is gamed by the tech overlords. They use it to their advantage. The people are furious,” said Bannon, whom Trump fired from his White House position during his first administration but who later reinvented himself through his War Room podcast as one of the chief evangelists of the Maga movement. Bannon further widened his aim to attack Musk’s fellow tech giants Peter Thiel and David Sacks for having South African heritage. “He [Musk] should go back to South Africa,” Bannon said. “Why do we have South Africans, the most racist people on earth, white South Africans, we have them making any comments at all on what goes on in the United States?” Arguing that Musk’s “sole objective is to become a trillionaire” and calling him a proponent of “techno-feudalism on a global scale”, Bannon said, “I don’t support that and we’ll fight it,” adding: “He won’t fight. He’s got the maturity of a little boy. “He will do anything to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money. “His aggregation of wealth, and then – through wealth – power: that’s what he’s focused on.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/12/steve-bannon-calls-elon-musk-racist', 'Chris Michael', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/65204f9b88f833ea736f5829224e935a5161b1d8/0_28_3000_1800/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 14:49:57', NULL, NULL),

Merely competing at this stage was an incredible feat, but the 26-year-old keeps on taking his game to new heights. Already the first Lebanese tennis player in the Open Era to reach the main draw of a grand slam tournament, on Sunday Habib became the first to win a match at a major after an immense performance in the first round of the Australian Open yielded a sublime 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (6) win over Bu Yunchaokete of China. It is his first-ever top-100 victory. “This is probably one of the best days of my career honestly,” he said. “It’s such an incredible feeling to get this win not only for myself but for Lebanon and Lebanese tennis. As you guys could see there, the crowd was absolutely wild. It made it even more special to win in front of them.” Habib’s trailblazing success is even more significant considering it has come at a time of war in his country. The past year has been a period of unimaginable pain for many Lebanese people as the country continues to pick up the pieces following Israel’s airstrikes and ground invasion of Lebanon, which have killed nearly 4,000 people, destroyed whole towns and villages, and displaced more than a million people. With Habib’s parents, other family and friends still living in Lebanon, he has spent much of the past year glued to his phone every morning as he has tried to check that his loved ones were all OK. His success has provided an unlikely source of inspiration for Lebanese people. “It’s a huge win, especially what we’ve been going through as a country,” he said. “I think to bring something positive, especially, we’ve been having a rough time with the war. We had our other issues in the past. It’s just nice to get this win for Lebanon and for the people.” Over the past two decades, Habib’s journey towards the top levels of professional tennis has taken him around the world. He was born in Houston, Texas, but his family returned to Lebanon when he was six years old. It was in Lebanon that he picked up tennis and began to learn his craft, but with their limited tennis infrastructure, he needed to train elsewhere in order to make it on the professional tour. Still, representing Lebanon was essential: “I grew up [there] and just the values that they have there and the people,” he says. “I just wanted to represent the country that I’ve lived in and been a part of the tennis culture and everyone back home. It’s a decision I made at a young age. It just gives me the motivation to keep going. To play for a small country is something special for me.” So many things had to go right for Habib to reach these heights. Going into the final week of competition on the ATP Challenger Tour last year, Habib was ranked No 320 and about 100 places below the Australian Open cut-off for the qualifying draw of the tournament. He ended his year with his best result at the time, winning a surprise first ATP Challenger title in Temuco, Chile, a result that catapulted him into a grand slam qualifying draw for the first time. It is rare for a debutant to qualify on the first occasion, yet three wins later Habib had held his nerve to reach the main draw this week and he has now won a match at the highest level. “The support I’ve been getting these last couple days have been incredible,” said Habib. “My phone has been absolutely blowing up. Just all my family back home. I actually have some family from Sydney that came out to watch. It’s been a special time for me to have all the Lebanese people join in the community. I felt the energy out there. They definitely helped me get through that win tonight.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/12/hady-habib--history-lebanon-australian-open-tennis', 'Tumaini Carayol at Melbourne Park', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/46f62ae2fd28390936a774c71d2cab6a52920c60/0_404_3241_1944/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 14:44:53', NULL, NULL),

In a joint statement following an unexpected visit by Somalia’s president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, both countries committed to “restore and enhance bilateral relations through full diplomatic representation in their respective capitals”. Ethiopia’s state minister for foreign affairs, Mesganu Arga Moach, called the step a “big milestone forward in our bilateral and brotherly relations”. The announcement is the latest indication that Ethiopia and Somalia have begun to turn a corner in their relations, following a controversial memorandum Ethiopia signed with Somaliland at the start of 2023 that caused a bitter rift between the East African neighbours. The memorandum reportedly involved Ethiopia securing access to a port along Somaliland’s coast in exchange for recognition of Somaliland’s independence from Somalia. Ethiopian officials have also said the deal included permission to build a naval facility along the Gulf of Aden coast. The memorandum provoked a fierce response from Somalia, which accused its larger neighbour of attempting to “annex” its territory and threatened war against Ethiopia to stop it. Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 claiming the borders of a former British protectorate in the region but neither Mogadishu nor the international community recognise it. It has functioned autonomously for over three decades. The diplomatic standoff risked undermining security cooperation between the two nations in their fight against al-Shabaab, the al-Qaida affiliate in Somalia that seeks to overthrow the central government, after Somalia announced plans to expel Ethiopia from a UN-backed peacekeeping mission fighting the group, in which Ethiopian troops play a significant role. Somalia has since said it would “reconsider” an Ethiopian troop presence, following a meeting of defence ministers of both countries this month, but said last month that it had obtained commitments for the mandated number of soldiers from other countries in case. Somali officials have said they do not oppose Ethiopia’s desire for access to a port, but take issue with its decision to bypass the central government and the use of Somali territories by Ethiopia to build a naval facility. In a social media post, Somalia’s ambassador to Ethiopia said part of what was agreed at the Addis Ababa meeting was a “one-door policy”, suggesting Ethiopia would not proceed by directly engaging Somaliland without Somalia’s permission. The sudden breakthrough in relations comes after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, mediated talks between the leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia in the Turkish capital last month. The discussions culminated in the Ankara declaration, in which Somalia’s president and Ethiopia’s prime minister pledged to resolve their differences through dialogue and to address their shared concerns. The Somali president’s visit to Ethiopia, the first in over a year, coincided with the participation of Somalia’s foreign minister in a meeting in Cairo with Eritrea and Egypt – both of which also have troubled relations with Ethiopia and forged an alliance in October to counter it. Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said the trio discussed the presence of non-Red Sea countries gaining access to the strategic waterway, telling reporters: “It is completely unacceptable to allow any military or naval presence by non-littoral states.” Egypt began supplying arms to Somalia last summer and is preparing to hold talks with Mogadishu regarding the deployment of Egyptian soldiers to join the peacekeeping mission supporting Somalia’s fight against al-Shabaab.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/somalia-and-ethiopia-agree-to-restore-diplomatic-ties-after-year-long-rift', 'Faisal Ali', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f8f2457235dd24abe80ddea192603ebd0d88490c/396_325_3116_1870/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 14:44:36', NULL, NULL),

Scotland remained the coldest place in the UK, with the Met Office reporting a low of -13.9C (7F) in Kinbrace in the northern Highlands. Wales experienced a low of -2.2C in Hawarden, Flintshire; England’s coldest temperature was -7.8C at Cavendish, Suffolk; and Northern Ireland recorded -1.5C at Katesbridge, Co Down. Greater London had temperatures of -6.2C, with it being -2.6C in the centre of the capital. Edinburgh reached a low of -1.7C, while Cardiff hit a comparatively balmy 3.2C, according to the forecaster’s data. It means that the UK as a whole has not had temperatures go above freezing at night since the year began, and the last time the temperatures were in positive figures was on New Year’s Eve. Jonathan Vautrey, a Met Office meteorologist, said it would feel considerably warmer in the early stages of next week, caused by southerly winds bringing warmer air. Another meteorologist at the Met Office, Greg Dewhurst, said that by Monday morning, Northern Ireland and western Scotland could have temperatures of between 9C and 10C. Most places would be between -1C and 3C, he added, warmer than recent nights. Next week is expected to start with a north-south split in terms of temperatures and wider weather. Northern Ireland and the northern half of the UK are forecast to be cloudy with outbreaks of patchy rain and temperatures between 9C and 12C, while central and southern areas could be drier, with temperatures between 5C and 8C. Tuesday will be similar, but potentially drier, with temperatures between 11C and 12C in the north and 8-9C in the south. A Met Office spokesperson said: “Daytime temperatures for the week ahead will typically be 9C to 12C by day and frost generally limited to central and southern counties of England and Wales at night with minimums around 2C to -2C.” Vautrey said warmer temperatures could lead to thawing snow and surface water on roads. Scotland and Northern Ireland are forecast to experience rain on Sunday night into Monday morning. Northern Ireland, north-west England and western Scotland could have strong winds, brought by the low pressure weather system moving in from the Atlantic. The winds could be “severe” for the Outer Hebrides and the highlands, Vautrey said. An amber cold weather health alert is in place from the UK Health Security Agency until 9am on Tuesday morning. The alert says a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely. Flood alerts are in place for England from the Environment Agency, and in Scotland from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Friday night brought the coldest January overnight temperature since 2010. Altnaharra, a hamlet in the Scottish Highlands, recorded -18.9C. Shap in Cumbria had reached -11C, and Heathrow registered -5C. The increased demand on energy supplies caused by the cold snap meant the government was forced to insist the UK had enough gas and electricity stocks to meet demand, after the owner of the country’s largest gas stores said levels had become “concerningly low”.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/12/uk-weather-temperatures-stay-below-zero-for-12-nights-running', 'Harry Taylor', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d7744feef220476629096b6dd9de5ed4f750a200/0_236_3888_2333/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 14:22:44', NULL, NULL),

Plus letters from <strong>Lesley Smith</strong>,<strong> Dr Caroline Bentham</strong> and <strong>Ken Baldry</strong>', 'Gaby Hinsliff makes some very interesting points in her article (The death of the middle-class professional spells danger for Labour, 2 January). But as so often, averages hide a range of experience. I look at my own graduate daughters and their contemporaries. My eldest is 27 and a junior doctor, so she earns more than those average graduate salaries (looking at gross not hourly rates). But some of her friends who graduated slightly earlier with very good degrees have high-flying jobs, earning more than £50,000 within a couple of years of graduation. Others, though, have struggled to find secure, well-paid jobs. My youngest (aged 24) has a public sector clerical job at about £25,000, and most of her peers are on similar salaries. The expansion of white-collar jobs in the postwar era fuelled social changes. It’s too soon to declare the middle-class professional dead, but the shrinking of that sector will also have profound social impacts. The obvious example is housing. We’re fortunate enough to be able to help both of our children into owner-occupation. But that won’t be the case for all. The effect will be to increase social divides and reduce social mobility. We’ll see a smaller number in high-paid white-collar jobs and some will start to question the value of a university education if all it leads to is debt and insecure employment. It’s not a happy prospect. Iain Forsyth London • As Gaby Hinsliff notes, human perception of success is a relative thing, and the expansion of salaries at the top is as disconcerting to those who think of themselves as the middle as the rise of the lowest. In higher education, the salaries of university lecturers are often shockingly poor, considering the qualifications required. Law graduates working for good firms can, within three years, be making many times the pay of those who so recently taught them. Graduates working in finance are even better rewarded. Whatever the economic arguments of taxation for top earners, the government must surely realise that there are much greater – if less immediately obvious – societal benefits to making ours a more equal country. Lesley Smith Oxford • Inflation plus stagnant wages plus a terrible job market means the jobs I’m now applying for pay 20% to 30% less than I was paid nine years ago, before I had a master’s and a PhD. As a recently graduated doctor of economics looking for work in the UK and in the public sector, the numbers just don’t work. I’m a single 36-year-old millennial woman and still live with my parents because of low wages and high housing costs. No wonder the birthrate is collapsing when we can’t afford our own place to live before our 40s – my own fertility window is rapidly closing, while I plug away at job applications rather than dating apps. Dr Caroline Bentham Wetherby, West Yorkshire • Gaby Hinsliff rightly highlights Peter Turchin’s book about overproducing elites. As a commentator of the 1790s observed about the drivers of the French Revolution “Beware of poor lawyers!” – an apt description of Robespierre, Danton and others. The pushing down of bourgeoise salaries has been obvious since Thatcher and Reagan introduced neo‑liberalism in the 1980s. Its endgame is a society of the super‑rich and equality for the rest at a level of poverty. This will not be sustainable.

The two soldiers were taken prisoner in Kursk oblast, the scene of intense fighting since Ukraine launched a cross-border raid five months ago. Video showed special forces soldiers carrying one of the wounded North Koreans across a snowy forest. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would give journalists access to the pair, so the world “can learn the truth about what is happening”. The prisoners have been transported to Kyiv and given appropriate “medical treatment” for their injuries, Zelenskyy said. He praised the paratroopers and tactical group that retrieved them, saying: “This was not an easy task”. Russian forces and North Korean military personnel had previously executed their wounded in order to “erase” any trace of Pyongyang’s involvement in Russia’s war against Ukraine, he claimed. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency is questioning the soldiers, who were given fake Russian names and military documents. The pair speak no foreign languages. South Korea’s NIS intelligence service has been assisting, the SBU said. The soldiers are the first captive North Koreans to survive. They represent a PR opportunity for Kyiv, during a precarious moment for Ukraine as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Zelenskyy is keen to emphasise that Ukraine is fighting an unprecedented coalition of malign autocratic states. One is North Korea, which has supplied Moscow with short-range ballistic missiles, artillery shells and – since last November – about 10,000 elite troops. Russia has also deepened its cooperation with Iran. Tehran provides kamikaze drones used in nightly attacks against Ukrainian towns and cities. China does not contribute directly military aid but is a key diplomatic ally and delivers micro-electronic components used extensively in Russian weapons systems. On Saturday, the SBU released video footage and photographs showing the two North Koreans in hospital bunks, one with bandaged hands, the other with a bandaged jaw. There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, wrote on social media: “We need maximum pressure against regimes in Moscow and Pyongyang.” The soldiers had reportedly told the SBU they were experienced fighters. One said he had been sent to Russia for training, not to fight. One had no identity documents, while the other was in possession of a Russian military ID card said to have been “issued in the name of another person”, a 26-year-old from Russia’s Tuva region, which borders Mongolia. According to the SBU he was a rifleman who was born in 2005 and had been in the North Korean army since 2021. The other wrote his answers due to his injured jaw, stating that he was born in 1999, had joined the army in 2016 and was a scout sniper. South Korea’s intelligence agency, NIS, confirmed Ukraine’s account, adding that one of the soldiers had said North Korean forces had suffered “significant losses during battle”. One of the men said he had gone without food or water for up to five days before his capture. Russia, meanwhile, reported that its military had advanced to within 3km of the strategically important town of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donetsk province and had seized a village south of the town. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had repelled 46 out of 56 attacks on about a dozen towns in the Pokrovsk sector. On Saturday, the Russian news agency RIA reported for the first time from the Ukrainian town of Kurakhove, a logistics centre south of Pokrovsk. Russian military said last week that it had captured the town, the scene of intense fighting. Ukrainian combat units recently pulled out of their last stronghold in Kurakhova, a thermal power plant. Ukraine’s military made gains in the Kursk border region, according to reports by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which said geolocated videos showed Ukrainian soldiers had advanced to just north of the village of Pogrebki. On Sunday, Germany’s chancellor said it was “no bad news” that Trump hoped to arrange a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in an effort, according to the incoming US president, to “get that war over with”. However, Olaf Scholz stressed that Ukraine’s sovereignty should not be called into question. Kyiv has rejected any deal that forces it to cede territory to Russia. Referring to his own telephone conversation with Putin last month, for which he received much criticism, Scholz told the broadcaster ARD: “The point will come when real conversations have to be had.” Germany, the second largest contributor to Ukraine’s war effort after the US, would continue to support Ukraine, he said, “but at the same time the killing has to stop at some point.” He said it was necessary to “find a way out of this war, without a dictated peace in which the Ukrainians have no say”. Early on Sunday, a Russian oil tanker that had run adrift in the Baltic Sea north of the German island of Rügen after suffering a blackout when its electricity supply failed, was manoeuvred safely into the port of Sassnitz by tug boats. The tanker, Eventim, containing an estimated 99,000 tons of oil, is believed to be part of an extensive operation by Moscow to try to circumnavigate sanctions, for which dilapidated, unseaworthy ships are often used. The 274-metre-long vessel with 24 crew members has effectively been impounded by authorities until a decision is made as to how to deal with it.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/ukraines-capture-of-north-koreans-offers-rare-insight-into-russian-alliance-says-zelenskyy', 'Luke Harding in Pavlohrad, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Mark Gerts', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6b0d4bad5dc2e68f495847f00c68eec645d6d555/0_53_1600_960/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 14:07:31', NULL, NULL),

We appeal to the education secretary to reconsider her decision to terminate funding for the Latin excellence programme (Letters, 31 December). We share the government’s desire to see equality of opportunity at the heart of educational provision, but believe that the Latin excellence programme has been successfully meeting exactly that challenge. Children at 40 non-selective state schools, the majority located in areas of economic deprivation, are now covered by the scheme, and more than a third of its by now over 5,000 pupils are eligible for free school meals – a remarkable uptake that indicates how exceptionally well the programme has been run. What these children have found in Latin is a subject that both challenges and inspires them, teaching them another language but also revealing to them the roots of English words and exposing them to some fascinating history, archaeology and art. We are convinced that Latin has a valuable role to play as part of the broad educational curriculum that the government rightly prizes, equipping children for the future by stimulating their interest and imagination while giving them the intellectual confidence that comes from getting to grips with an ancient language. We are especially saddened at the decision to end funding of the programme mid-year. We express our hope that consideration be given to children at key stage 4 who are working toward GCSE, and that, at the very least, the programme may be allowed to continue until the end of this academic year.

It was the 1960s, and she had just spent a few years working for a private detective and modelling. But she always loved adventure, including stock car racing, climbing and acrobatics. “I enjoyed anything that was sporty or tomboyish,” said Aldam, now 83. “I began doing action work after being introduced to a stunt man, and immediately made a name for myself – there were only two other girls doing stunt work at the time.” Aldam has since had an illustrious career spanning six decades. She doubled for Mary Ure in the film Where Eagles Dare and for Sharon Tate in the Wrecking Crew (both released in 1968), and performed in six James Bond movies including Skyfall (2012). This week, the contributions of Aldam and other British stunt performers to the film and TV industry is being celebrated with a donation from the British Stunt Register (BSR), a UK-based professional body, to the British Film Institute. The BSR is giving a rare first edition of its early members directory from 1973 to the BFI Reuben Library. It includes the biggest names in the stunt world, such as Aldam, alongside the likes of Reg Harding (Indiana Jones), Cyd Child (The Avengers), Richard “Dicky” Graydon (James Bond), Joe Powell (The Man Who Would be King) and Jim Dowdall (Saving Private Ryan). “Stunt work has massively changed since when I first started out,” Aldam said. “Then, you were just asked if you could do the job. You signed a blood chip to say you were responsible for your own accidents. There were no wires or protection.” According to Dowdall, much of the progress in the stunt profession is because of the founding of the BSR by performers in 1973. Before then, stunt artists worked as extras on films and were given additional pay for performing a “gag” such as falling down the stairs, crashing a car or being involved in a fight sequence. The work often attracted former military personnel, professional horse riders, exhibition divers, circus performers, boxers and wrestlers. Work often came through word-of-mouth introductions. But the directory created a pool of stunt professionals, and helped introduce better safety protections. These days, to join the register and become a BSR-qualified stunt performer, you need qualifications across at least six different sporting areas in four of the following groups: fighting (compulsory), falling, riding and driving, agility and strength, or water. “There was no health and safety before,” said Dowdall, who is a former chair of the BSR committee. “Now things have tightened up hugely. The equipment got better, personal pads got better. We fall on airbags instead of cardboard boxes.” His own career has been one long rollercoaster ride. Before entering the stunt business, he worked in the circus for a lion trainer and as an acrobat, was an armourer for films, and spent time in the Parachute regiment. He has doubled for Harrison Ford in Force 10 from Navarone (1978) and Hanover Street (1979), Roger Moore in Octopussy (1983) and Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye (1995) and Die Another Day (2002). “On Octopussy I was running and fighting on top of a train,” said Dowdall, now 75. “In Die Another Day, I was in the Aston Martin on the ice.” Many of these stunts have been highly dangerous. Dowdall almost broke his neck falling down a well once. Doubling as Tate on Where Eagles Dare, Aldam said she once had to “step out from a moving cable car at 70ft up with nothing other than 8ft of water to drop into”. She also recalled doubling for Deborah Kerr in the 1967 spoof Bond film Casino Royale, when she had to escape from a castle in wellington boots and a black neglige and nighty. “I came off on a swinging pipe at a height of 80ft.” Aldam has had her fair share of serious injuries. During a sequence for The Wrecking Crew – during which she and a colleague had to land a helicopter at 40 mph on to the back of the container lorry on a freight wagon – she fell and broke her back in three places, as well as her collarbone, shoulder blade and six ribs. “A telephone cable snapped and wound around my throat. I slid backwards as the container lorry went out from under me, and I remember seeing the ground and hitting it with my shoulder. They had to withdraw 400cc of blood from my punctured lung. I was 2cm from being paralysed from the waist down,” Aldam said. Fourteen weeks later, she was back at work. It’s only now that she ready to slow down. In 2023, Aldam performed in the films Wicked part 2, Blitz and Old Guy and the TV spy thriller Slow Horses in the space of a few months. “So you could say I’m going out on a high”, she said with a laugh. “My daughter is an intensive care consultant, and she’s appalled by me still working at this age. She says: ‘I’m the one who puts them back together, mother.’” The BFI said the gift of the directory came from a relationship forged through its recent Art of Action film season. The 1973 directory will be catalogued, digitised for viewing access and preserved as part of the Reuben library’s Ariston collection. Stunt performers hope this is the beginning of a new era of respect and recognition for their work. Despite the artistry and risks involved in professional stunt work, for example, there is still no special category at awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and Oscars. “Every other department is recognised: wardrobe, hair, makeup, sound, but we’re not,” Dowdall said. Aldam added: “We deserve our own category, especially when even people like Tom Cruise are doing stunts now. Everybody I’ve worked with has always given their best. The least we deserve is a little bit of recognition.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/12/uk-stunt-artists-celebrated-with-donation-register-bfi-library', 'Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/abae6e5ea6336e52f5b9cb65d420ac9b1b7ca77c/121_97_535_321/500.jpg', '2025-01-12 14:00:37', NULL, NULL),

Three wildfires were still burning Sunday morning in Los Angeles county, where more than 150,000 people remained under an evacuation warning. Firefighters said shifting Santa Ana winds could blow the Palisades fire, which has razed almost 24,000 acres, back on itself towards the coast. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, said on Sunday the fires would be the worst natural disaster in US history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope”. Newsom told NBC’s Meet the Press he had signed an executive order that would speed up disaster relief for victims. More than 12,300 homes and businesses have been destroyed, and more than 200,000 people displaced. Meanwhile president-elect Donald Trump, who returns to the White House in eight days, continued to point fingers, taking to his Truth Social platform to level new criticism at Newsom and other California officials for alleged mismanagement before and during the outbreaks. On Friday, Newsom ordered an inquiry into LA county’s water management after reports emerged that a critical reservoir was offline when the fires started, leaving some emergency hydrants with low water pressure before running dry. The LA fire chief, Kristin Crowley, has been vocal about how water supply issues – and budget cuts – “failed” her firefighters. Trump and other Republican politicians have singled out the beleaguered Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, for signing a budget that stripped $17m from the Los Angeles fire department. “The fires are still raging in LA. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. What’s wrong with them?” Trump wrote. He has made a succession of false claims aimed at Newsom and other Democrats. In an interview on Saturday with the podcast Pod Save America, Newsom said Trump was “delusional”, and attacked his threats to withhold disaster relief funds. “He’s done it in the past, not just here in California. The rhetoric is very familiar, it’s increasingly acute, and obviously we all have reason to be concerned about it,” the governor said. In the NBC interview on Sunday, he added: “Responding to Donald Trump’s insults, we would spend another month. Every elected official that he disagrees with is very familiar with them. Mis- and disinformation I don’t think advantages or aids any of us.” Forecasters, meanwhile, said a “red flag” warning would remain in place across Los Angeles county as winds picked up on Sunday, combined with cooler weather, and threatened further devastation. “Dry vegetation combined with the prolonged extreme fire weather conditions will support rapid spread and erratic behavior of any new or existing fires,” the National Weather Service said in a statement. A glimmer of hope came with news that the smaller Kenneth fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties had been completely contained, and the Hurst fires in Los Angeles county was 89% under control. That will free more of the 14,000 firefighters and other personnel, from multiple states as well as Mexico and Canada, to focus on the more severe, and deadly Palisades and Eaton fires, officials said. The four fires have consumed about 62 sq miles (160 sq km), the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), reported. All the reported deaths came from the Palisades and Eaton fires, which officials said were respectively only 11% and 27% contained by early Sunday. The death toll is expected to rise. Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), warned Sunday that a significant threat remained. “The winds are potentially getting dangerous and strong again. I believe the red flag warnings have been put back in place. This is still dangerous, and [people] need to make sure they’re listening to their local officials so they can keep themselves safe,” she told CNN’s State of the Union. “I know that so many people probably want to get back into the area and check on their homes, but with winds picking back up, you never know which way they’re going to go. So they really need to pay attention, listen to what’s going on so they don’t get in harm’s way.” County officials said Saturday that 22 people were arrested in the Eaton and Palisades fires, many charged with burglary and looting. A 6pm to 6am county wide curfew was in place, partly to protect the property of evacuated homeowners. Officials issued new evacuation orders for eastern communities threatened by the Palisades fire, including the affluent Brentwood area. The city’s Mandeville Canyon Road is a narrow two-lane road that makes emergency access to, and evacuations from, the area’s pricey homes difficult. The orders also encompass the Getty Center, which houses a large art collection, the Los Angeles Times reported. A spokesperson for the J Paul Getty Trust, which funds the museum, said the institution was complying with the evacuation order and is now closed, with only emergency personnel in place.

A monthly survey by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) found that an index of consumer confidence improved by 1.3 points to 112.2 last month, to give the highest score since August 2021 (112.9). Workers who responded to the poll reported an improved outlook for their household finances. Workers said there were “significant gains in business activity over the previous 30 days (+3.0) and they were looking forward to year ahead (+1.5), revealing a more buoyant economy in the run up to Christmas than seen in the months immediately before and after Reeves’s October budget. Homeowners were more likely to say the outlook for property values had improved – up by 2.9 points to 119.2. However, Sam Miley, the CEBR’s managing economist said the improved mood among workers may be shortlived. The first weeks of 2025 have brought considerable uncertainty, which could impact these metrics moving forward. The outlook for the economy is weakening, amidst expectations of continually high inflation and concern over the potential for further tax rises. Meanwhile, the recent turbulence in government debt markets could hinder any potential reduction in mortgage costs over the coming months, impacting household finances and property prices. Whether consumers can ride out this wave of uncertainty by continuing to express net positivity will be key to the economy’s performance this year. Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has extended Jonathan Brearley’s term as chief executive for five more years, to 31 January 2030. In 2023, Ofgem’s incoming chair Mark McAllister suggested that Blearley could be replaced, after a turbulent few years which caused staff morale to slump and supplier complaints to increase. The regulator admitted in 2022 that British households would have been better off weathering the winter gas crisis if it had acted sooner to crack down on financially unstable energy suppliers. However, today McAllister said: Jonathan has led Ofgem through unprecedented challenges over the past five years: the fallout from Covid-19, energy market turbulence and the price shock following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He and his senior team have shown great dedication in stepping up to meet these challenges, whilst establishing the foundations required to create a clean power electricity system to get us to net zero by 2050 – the biggest ever transformation of the energy industry. This has involved developing and executing vital changes in how we plan, build, and supervise the roll out of new energy infrastructure, at a pace not seen for decades, while also reshaping a retail market that can be innovative and dynamic for customers. At the same time, Jonathan has taken tough measures to ensure suppliers meet the high standards consumers rightly expect, while stamping out bad practice wherever it exists. Brearley said: The government’s 2030 target for a clean electricity grid is tough but achievable, if everyone plays their part. We have plans in place to get there at the lowest possible cost for consumers and businesses, while unlocking the private investment needed to expand the grid and generate more clean power. In financial markets, the pound and the euro are continuing to slide against the dollar, which has been boosted by strong economic data, while stock markets are heading lower, and oil prices have jumped. Crude oil prices are rising for a third day, driven by wider US sanctions on Russian oil exports. The new sanctions, announced at the end of last week, include oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil – targeting revenue that Moscow is using to fund its war against Ukraine. This will prompt China and India to source more oil from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, boosting prices and shipping costs, according to traders and analysts. Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, told Reuters: There are genuine fears in the market about supply disruption. The worst case scenario for Russian oil is looking like it could be the realistic scenario. But it’s unclear what will happen when Donald Trump takes office next Monday. Brent crude futures rose by more than 2% or $1.68 a barrel to as high as $81.68 a barrel, the highest since August, and is now trading at $80.81 a barrel, up by 1.3%. US West Texas Intermediate crude touched a peak of $78.58 a barrel and is now at $77.69 a barrel, up by 1.5%. Low- to middle-income families in Britain are far poorer than their counterparts in western Europe because of sky-high housing costs, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation. The thinktank said that while prices in the UK were 8% higher than the average in the 38 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), less well-off Britons were more affected by the cost of housing, which is 44% higher in the UK than the OECD average. Higher housing costs in the UK more than offset the benefit of food, another major area of spending for those on lower incomes, being 12% cheaper than the average in those developed countries. When lower-income families’ tendency to spend more on necessities and less on luxuries is factored in, German families are 21% or £2,300 a year better off than their UK equivalents and the gap with Dutch families is even wider, at 39%. As many as one in six workers in Britain are skipping meals to make ends meet as households remain under pressure from the higher cost of groceries, energy and other essentials. Highlighting the impact of the cost of living crisis on working households, figures from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) showed 17% of full- or part-time workers had skipped a meal to reduce their spending in the past three months. According to a survey of more than 2,500 working adults by YouGov in the week before Christmas, carried out on behalf of the trade unions’ umbrella group, as many as one in 10 said they had skipped a meal every day or most days. The Post Office said separately that cash withdrawals at its branches topped £1bn in December, the first time on record that this has happened in a single month, as people relied on cash to manage budgets. About £979m of personal cash withdrawals were made, and £35m of business cash withdrawals. Apple has asked shareholders to vote against a proposal to scrap its diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, as tech rivals scale back similar schemes before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative thinktank, wants the iPhone maker to end its DEI efforts because they expose companies to “litigation, reputational and financial risks”. The proposal will be voted on at Apple’s annual general meeting on 25 February. In a notice to shareholders, Apple’s board has recommended investors vote against the proposal because, it says, it already has the right compliance procedures to deal with any risks and because the proposal “inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies”. DEI schemes are sets of measures designed to make people of all backgrounds – including ethnicity, class, sexuality and gender – feel supported and included in the workplace. Last week, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it was terminating its DEI programmes immediately. Senior bankers at Lloyds could be at risk of having their bonuses docked if they fail to follow company orders to be in the office at least two days a week. Lloyds Banking Group – which owns the Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland brands – has confirmed it is reviewing office attendance as part of performance-related bonus targets for its most senior employees. That includes hybrid staff who, in 2023, were ordered to be in the office at least 40% of the time, which typically amounts to two days a week for those on full-time contracts. Ged Nichols, the general secretary of the Accord union that represents Lloyds staff, said bosses needed to ensure they were sensitive to employees’ circumstances when considering the size of this year’s payouts. “The inclusion of a metric on complying with the requirement for some staff to attend offices for 40% of their working time should not create problems if it is applied fairly, and is sensitive to individuals’ circumstances with mature and reasonable judgments applied,” Nichols said. Bonuses for the 2024 financial year will be paid out next month, shortly after the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, announces annual results on 20 February. Recruitment companies have warned about declining confidence across Europe and the UK, as political uncertainty adds to concerns about economic growth. The FTSE 250 recruiter PageGroup said today that profits had dropped by nearly a quarter in Germany and 17% in France during the last three months of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. Its UK profits fell by 14%, as companies grew more nervous about taking on new staff. Morgan McKinley, another British recruiter, said the number of job openings in London’s financial services sector dropped by 12% year on year in the final quarter of 2024. The recruiters’ gloom will add to concerns about the prospects for the economies of the eurozone, and the UK. Europe’s largest economies are struggling with faltering growth. Germany, the EU’s largest economy, has oscillated between growth and contraction every quarter for the last two years, while narrowly avoiding a technical recession. The economic struggles contributed to the collapse of the three-way “traffic light” coalition and an early election next month. France is also going through a period of political instability, with the centrist prime, minister François Bayrou, trying to lead the country’s fourth government of the last 12 months. More on GSK’s acquisition of a rare cancer specialist firm, Massachusetts-based IDRx. It is paying $1bn upfront and a further $150m milestone payments if the firm’s lead treatment is successful. It is working on a treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), a rare cancer that develops in the digestive system and is diagnosed in 80,000 to 120,000 new patients worldwide every year. Two fifths of cases are driven by mutations in the KIT gene that lead to the growth of tumour cells. IDRx’s experimental treatment, called IDRX-42 at this stage, targets those mutations. It has published promising data from an early-stage clinical trial in patients with advanced GIST. Tim Clackson, chief executive of IDRx, said: We are looking forward to working with GSK to advance IDRX-42 for patients with GIST given there have been no major advances to the standard of care for almost 20 years. Combining our experience to date with GSK’s expertise in GI cancers, global clinical development capability, and strong commercial presence in oncology will help to accelerate the development of this novel medicine for patients. GSK has a growing portfolio in development targeting gastrointestinal cancers. Tony Wood, the British drugmaker’s chief scientific officer, said: We are excited by the early data from IDRX-42 and its unique ability to target all clinically relevant KIT mutations present in GIST, a major gap in the current standard of care. We look forward to accelerating its development in 2025 to redefine treatment. There are no approved drugs, known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, that inhibit the full spectrum of clinically relevant primary and secondary mutations in the KIT gene. IDR-x was launched in Plymouth, near Boston, in August 2022 by entrepreneurs Ben Auspitz, who serves as chief executive, and Alexis Borisy, to develop precision cancer medicines. Christoph Lengauer acts as scientific adviser. The first financing round was led by the Californian venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and New York-based Casdin Capital. The firm’s pipeline including IDRX-42 was acquired through licence agreements with German drugmaker Merck and Massachusetts-based Blueprint Medicines. With the US dollar charging ahead, the pound has fallen to levels last seen in the autumn of 2023. Sterling has dropped by 0.76% to $1.2111. The euro also extended losses against the greenback, falling to its lowest level since September 2022 against the dollar. The single currency slid by nearly 0.6% and is now worth $1.0185. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The dollar is flexing more muscle amid expectations that borrowing costs will stay higher for longer, helping push down the pound to $1.21 levels not seen since October 2023. Sterling has also dipped against the euro to 1.18. It comes amid ongoing concerns about the outlook for the UK economy, with the spectre of stagflation hovering. Wednesday’s CPI data will be closely watched especially given that the reading is set to show consumer prices will veer further away from the Bank of England’s 2% target, making it less likely that policymakers will vote for a cut in February. The UK government is attempting to wrest the narrative away from painfully high borrowing costs and a plunging pound. It’s going all out on an AI pitch with recommendations to unleash the power of the technology to help public services become more efficient and help boost growth via special development zones. Traders are no longer fully pricing in an interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve by the end of the year, Fed fund futures show. Bets on further interest rate cuts have been scaled back sharply since Friday’s blockbuster labour market report underscored the strength of the US economy. Economists had forecast that the economy added 155,000 jobs in December, but a reading of 256,000 blew past estimates, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, while analysts had expected it to stay at 4.2%. On Wednesday, the latest monthly figures are expected to show the inflation in the United States rose to an annual rate of 2.8% in December from 2.7% in November. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is forecast to have stayed at 3.3%. Markets will also be watching producer price data, out tomorrow. The US Federal Reserve has voiced concerns about core inflation trends, as Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, noted. Note that the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] minutes last [week] contained the observation that core inflation trends had been disappointing recently and that several members feared that the disinflation process might have stalled. UK rate cut expectations have also receded, with traders now pencilling in nearly 42 basis points of reductions by year-end. Until recently, they had fully priced in two 25bp rate reductions this year, which would take the Bank of England’s base rate from 4.75% to 4.25%. The UK’s inflation rate is expected to have edged up to 2.7% in December from 2.6% the month before, followed by a bigger acceleration in price pressures in coming months. The figures will be released first thing on Wednesday. China’s exports in December grew at a faster pace than expected, as manufacturers rushed to fill orders, faced with the threat of higher tariffs from the new Donald Trump administration. Exports rose by 10.7% from a year earlier, according to official customs data. Economists had forecast that they would grow by about 7%. Imports also rose, by 1% year-on-year, against expectations of a 1.5% decline. With exports outpacing imports, China’s trade surplus grew to $104.8bn, and to just under $1 trillion for 2024 as a whole. Lynn Song, ING’s chief economist for Greater China, said: December’s trade balance data ended the year on a positive note, with both the monthly and annual data ($992.2bn) marking new record highs. The monthly trade surplus cleared the $100bn barrier for the first time on record, though the annual trade surplus fell a little shy of reaching the $1 trillion mark. China’s consumption could see a modest recovery in 2025, depending on how effective policy support is, but it remains uncertain how much of this will translate into stronger import demand as policies look likely to benefit domestic producers more. External demand has been an important contributor to growth momentum in 2024, not only through the record trade surplus but also the impact on manufacturing. However, with the looming prospect of increased tariffs and expectations for generally moderating global growth, external demand looks likely to soften in 2025. Our ING scenario currently has tariffs starting to take effect in the second quarter of this year, with tariffs on China potentially coming earlier. Chris Turner, ING’s head of markets, has looked at the moves in currency markets: Friday’s strong US jobs release has provided another leg higher for the dollar. It is hard to see the dollar trend changing this week given the prospect of another strong set of US inflation data, which will increasingly raise the question of whether the Fed needs to cut rates this year at all. Focus will also remain on the beleaguered pound, where Wednesday sees new inflation figures and a 10-year gilt auction. Friday’s better-than-expected US December jobs data drove the dollar cleanly higher across the board. This feeds into the narrative of US exceptionalism and has now pared back expectations of the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle to barely one 25bp rate cut this year. The big question for the market now is whether the Fed really needs to cut at all this year. At the same time, dollar strength and firm US yields are pressure-testing the financial system. UK assets markets are starting to creak, but perhaps the most significant battleground today is in China. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has announced more measures in an attempt to support the renminbi, which has fallen to 16-month lows. China’s onshore yuan traded at 7.3318 per dollar, not far from a 16-month low of 7.3328 hit on Friday. The yuan has lost more than 3% to the dollar since the U. election in early November, on worries that Donald Trump’s threats of fresh trade tariffs will pile more pressure on the struggling Chinese economy. Today, the central bank relaxed macro-capital measures, allowing Chinese corporates and financial institutions to raise more money overseas. Just as US tariffs loom when Trump begins his presidency next week, China reported a massive trade surplus in December of nearly $105bn. It would not be a surprise to Trump commenting on this today, Turner said. The only currency withstanding the dollar onslaught at the moment is the Japanese yen. Japan was closed today for a holiday, but it seems the threat of more Bank of Japan intervention… plus the chances of a BoJ 25bp rate hike on 24 January – now priced at 52% – are providing the yen with some support. UK bond markets have just opened, and yields are up again – by about 5 basis points across all maturities. US and German yields have also edged higher. The yield, or interest rate, on the 30-year gilt (UK government bond) has hit 5.472%, still the highest since 1998, up by 6 basis points on the day. Stock markets have opened lower, with the FTSE 100 index in London falling 20 points, or 0.2%, to 8,228. Germany’s Dax, France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MiB all lost 0.3% while Spain’s Ibex fell by 0.5%. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid said: It’s hard to determine what’s icier at the moment, global bond markets or the weather across much of Northern Europe and even New York where sub zero temperatures have been the norm in recent days. As the weather warms up a bit, whether the deep freeze in bond markets continues may be determined by how US CPI [consumer prices index] on Wednesday materialises after Friday’s blockbuster payrolls report. Annuity rates have surged following the turmoil in the bond markets. Annuity rates are affected by long-term gilt yields, which rose sharply last week. The latest data from Hargreaves Lansdown shows a 65-year-old with a £100,000 pension can now get up to £7,425 a year from a single life level annuity with a five-year guarantee. This is up from £7,235 a year last week, and 48% higher than this time three years ago when it was £5,003. Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The turmoil in the bond markets has caused annuity incomes to soar, giving an extra boost to a market that has already enjoyed a stellar year. We could see further income rises in the weeks to follow and this could push incomes up to the highs we saw in the aftermath of the mini-budget. Annuities continue to provide great value, and we can expect to see interest in them continue to increase, with many retirees deciding that now is the time to take the plunge and get a guaranteed income for life. She said that it is important to check different providers because once bought, an annuity cannot be unwound. There is no need to annuitise all your pensions at the same time – people can annuitise in stages throughout their retirement, she said. This means your remaining pot can remain invested in income drawdown where it can grow while you get the potential to take advantage of higher annuity incomes as you age. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The pound is on the slide again, as Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, returns to her desk after her trip to China. The dollar has jumped to the highest level in more than two years against a basket of major currencies, to peak at 108.98, extending last week’s rally, after a strong US jobs market report underscored the strength of the world’s largest economy. Sterling fell more than 0.5% to $1.2128 against the dollar, the lowest in 14 months while the euro is at its weakest since November 2022 at $1.0275. The pound had a rough ride last week, as UK government bonds, known as gilts, sold off, pushing their yields higher, reflecting investors’ concerns about the UK’s public finances. Bond yields rose sharply for governments worldwide, before falling back on Friday, after the last jobs report of the Biden administration showed the US labour market grew strongly in December. This morning, US and German yields are edging higher again. UK officials will be monitoring closely moves in the price of government bonds after last week’s turmoil in global markets, when the yield – effectively the interest rate – on the 30-year bond hit its highest level since 1998. Expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts have receded sharply, but also for UK rate cuts. Markets are awaiting US data on inflation on Wednesday. If the bond selloff is sustained, it could force the chancellor to make adjustments to her tax and spending plans or risk breaking her fiscal rules. Reeves has vowed to stand by her “non-negotiable” fiscal rules. We reported last week that the Treasury was considering steeper cuts to public services while the Telegraph reported that disability benefits faced billion-pound cuts. GSK, the UK’s second-biggest pharmaceutical firm, has struck a deal to buy Boston-based firm IDRx, which is developing a treatment for a rare type of gastrointestinal tumours. GSK is paying up to $1.15bn under the terms of the deal, which will strengthen its oncology portfolio. Chief executive Emma Walmsley has been making targeted acquisitions to boost key areas, after slimming down the overall drugs portfolio in recent years. GSK’s chief commercial officer, Luke Miels, said IDRX-42 complements our growing portfolio in gastrointestinal cancers. This acquisition is consistent with our approach of acquiring assets that address validated targets and where there is clear unmet medical need, despite existing approved products.

I’ve not seen much of this match with all that’s been going on, but apparently Snigur is a strange kind of player and the set was not an easy one. On Kia, Paul now leads O’Connell 6-2 3-6 4-1, while on Court, Collins leads Snigur 4-3 in their first-set breaker. Next on Laver: Naomi Osaka v Caroline Garcia. Not bad! “In the end it was great,” says Djokovic, noting that his opponent was the better player for a set and a half and deserved all the applause he got. He’d not seen his opponent play until a few days ago and these kinds of matches are always dangerous, praising a “complete player” who “pleasantly surprised” him with his quality. We learn that Basavareddy’s What’sApp pic is of Djokovic, who laughs, unsure how to react. He then further rhapsodises a “nice boy” who handles himself well, and is sure we’ll all be seeing more of him. Finally, of course, we go to Andy Murray, discussing his skiing, but it’s all business now. It was a little strange to have his old foe in his box, but Coach Muzz offered some great advice mid-match and, now the players’ box is courtside, it offers them a fresh perspective to help. Djokovic will have to play much better than that if he’s to win a record 25th major. Of course he will, but whether he can play well enough is less clear. Still, he’s into round two and will meet Jaime Faria next, but let’s give credit to Basavareddy who played superbly until fatigue set in. He’s got a big future and I’m excited to see how he goes from here. …and Djokovic doubles! Rubbish under pressure, that lad, a total joker. Hold tight Nishesh Basavareddy, who quickly makes 0-30 … so Djokovic retorts with an ace down the middle and a body-serve that incites a long return. A wide return then means match point number two…. …for as long as it takes Basavareddy to leave a Djokovic forehand return which catches the line. Match point no 2 coming up … and disappearing via long return. From there, Basavareddy closes out, so at 4-6 63 6-4 5-2, Djokovic will shortly serve for the match. Djokovic soon makes 30-40, but a long forehand burns his first match point. And from there, Basavareddy finds reserves of strength to unleash a flat forehand that’s too good … only to go long with another having opening the space for it with a booming serve. We’re back at deuce… Meantime on Kia, Paul – confusingly clad in green and gold – hangs in there to break Collins, then consolidates to lead 1-1 3-0. And in the time it takes me type that, Djokovic unfurls more aces to consolidate for 5-1. He’s a game away. Ach, up 3-1 in the fourth, Djokovic raises a point for the double-break and outlasts Basavareddy in another sapping rally, the young American volleying wide after being handed a variety of moon-balls, top-spinners and flat animals. At 2-1 4-1, this match is almost over. Snigur, a former Wimbledon junior champ, has broken Collins, but as I type she’s broken back and we’re at 4-4 in the first. Down 2-1 in the fourth, Basavareddy makes deuce on the Djokovic serve, then regains it with a blazing forehand return, hooked down the line. But an ace restores advantage and a service-winner seals a crucial hold, Djokovic leading 2-1 3-1. On Kia, Christopher O’Connell has just levelled his match against Tommy Paul seeded 12, at a set apiece. I daresay a few of those who were on Cain are now supporting the local lad here, so I’d expect a lot of noise and shenaniga. Email! “Hard to watch the Kyrgios v Fearnley match with hardly any applause for Fearnley,” writes Niamh Brennan. “Worse is the cheering of faults and unforced errors from the rowdy crowd. Favouritism is one thing, rudeness is another.” I know what you mean, but going by his interview, Fearnley enjoyed the challenge and the occasion. Coming through that match must feel pretty special. Oh, I’ve just put on Mertens v Golubic to watch the final set and what I fact watch is Mertens celebrating. She wins 4-6 7-6 6-4 and meets Jessica Pegula (7) next. Yeah, Djokovic breaks Basavareddy at the start of set three to lead 2-1 1-0, and this experience will be very helpful for both men. The former is now used to the court and balls, while the latter now knows what it takes to compete at the top level. We’re under way again on Court, Collins leading Snigur 2-1 on serve. Fearnley knew it’d be a rowdy match and he really enjoyed it, saying he felt bad for Kyrgios, struggling with injury. He was trying to focus on himself, knowing he’d not be able to get the crowd on his side, and thinks this is probably the best match he’s ever played. He’s never experienced anything like tonight but had some heckles thrown his way playing college and is sure the experience will be good for him. When he heard he was facing Kyrgios he felt nerves and excitement but the tennis both produced near the end of the match made it really enjoyable to play. He focused and lent on his team to keep the noise out and, finally, asked by Mac as to the whereabouts of his Scottish accent, he says it’s coming back the more he stays out of the US. That’ll be barry. That is a sensational win for Fearnley, on debut in the competition. It’s true that Kyrgios, two years away, struggled physically, but the way he handled the atmosphere and occasion, sticking to his plan and staying cool throughout, was extremely impressive. Necxt for him it’s Arthur Cazaux, and that should be a really fun contest. Back on Cain, Kyrgios is struggling, shorn of the serve that makes him special. Fearnley leads their third-set breaker 5-1, is serving, and this is almost over; as I type, a netted return hands him five match points. Djokovic reasons with himself in celebration when Basavareddy nets, handing him 40-30 and set point; a backhand sent wide and he’s roaring his delight, his new coach also on his feet. Djokovic leads 4-6 6-3 6-4. Basavareddy isn’t going away, a decent return of a second serve giving him 15-30. But terrifying hitting form Djokovic level the game, which we’ll come back to in a moment because, on Cain, Fearnley has held to earn a third-set breaker, in which he breaks immediately; Kyrgios quickly fights back to trail 1-2. Ach, bad news on 1573 Arena, where Griggzy Dimitrov has been forced to retire when trailing Francesco Passaro 7-6 2-1; he meets Goffin or Bonzi next, the latter up two sets and a break. Fearnley earns break point, well saved by Kyrgios with big first serve and backhand down the line, and seconds later the Aussie holds for 0-2 6-5; back on Laver, Basavareddy holds nicely, forcing Djokovic to serve for set two at 4-6 6-3 5-4. Other hand, I guess Fearnley is from Scotland, so. Hands! Kyrgios sends Fearnley to the backhand corner and though the response is a good, he’s there at the net to caresses a winning volley and make deuce. He’s two points away from the set and the crowd go wild when the young Scot nets. Again, though, he’s nails on the big point, a big serve and forehand winner restoring parity in the game, and from there, he closes out for 2-0 5-5. This is so impressive: he’s never played in this tournament, and the local hero in a night sesh and on a party court is quite the introduction. Kyrgios holds for 6-7 3-6 5-4, forcing Fearnley to serve to stay in the set; on Laver, Djokovic leads Basavareddy 4-6 6-4 4-2, and is on the march. Oh, in all the excitement I’ve forgotten to relay that Karolina Muchova, seeded 20 and a favourite of this blog, leads Natalia Podoroska 6-1 5-1, while Mertens has levelled her match with Golubic at a set apiece; she leads 2-1 in the decider, on serve. Next on Court: Daria Snigur v Danielle Collins (10). Alcaraz says he’s trying to become a better player and person every day. He’s glad to have his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero with him after last year’s enforced absence, is happy with his level today, and hopes to enjoy his next match – which he knows will be tough – and put on a show for the people. Finally, asked to rank his golf swing alongside that of Nadal and Sinner, he laughs for a while then goes himself first, then Nadal, then sinner, saying it’s not personal. He is so much fun, and a stone-cold killer. Kyrgios holds for 0-2 4-3 and the crowd are well into this now; it’s a big test for Fearnley, who’s maintained equilibrium in impressive style thus far. He meets Yoshihito Nishioka next and will be much better for what was a more thorough examination than the score suggests. Shevchnko can play – but so can Alcaraz. Which he converts when Fearnley nets! We’re back on serve in set three at 7-6 6-3 3-3 and some muscle-bros in the crowd celebrate by acting like they’re Kyrgios himself. This is not yet over. …and finally earning a break point! Alcaraz, meantime, is almost home, up 6-1 7-5 5-1 and serving for the match, though Shevchenko has given a decent account of himself. And on Cain, Kyrgios is experiencing a ninth wind, forcing Fearnley to deuce… Basavareddy endures a nasty-looking quad-massage before getting back to it, a brutal flat forehand making 15-0 and suggesting he’s feeling better. But he’s soon down 15-30, Djokivic’s consistency from the back too much, and the break, secured to 15, suggests that this match is over as a contest. Djokovic leads 4-6 6-3 1-0. Fearnley has broken Kyrgios and now leads 7-6 7-3 3-1; there’s no sense he’s getting nervous, and no reason he should. His opponent is struggling physically and technically and doesn’t have what it’d take to fight back from here. Djokovic serves out to level the match at one set apiece as Basavareddy limps about, clearly cramping. He sucks on a gel of some sort and will, I imagine take a break, because the toll of playing a bionic freak of nature is considerable. It’s hard to see how he wins from here, but whatever happens next, he’s announced himself as a talent. Djokovic is forcing Basavareddy into places he’s never been before, horrible, painful, scary places. Almost all of his service-points are now a struggle, and up advantage Djokovic forces the error, hollering to the crowd. At 4-6 5-3, he will now serve for the second set. Felix Auger-Aliassime, seeded 29 – another getting further not nearer a Slam – has beaten Jan-Leonard Struff 6-3 6-0 4-6 6-1. He meets Davidovich Fokina next, the Spaniard having led 7-6 5-2 when Jerry Shang retired. I’ve lost count of how many apologies have been issued by our commentary team for Kyrgios’ language. It’s really very upsetting, I bet there’s no swearing in rugby union, why can’t everyone behave like rugby union players. We’ve had two holds in srt three, meaning Fearnley leads 7-6 7-3 1-1, while Alcaraz has of course broke and held to lead Shevchenko 6-1 7-5. I guess Fearnley’s trajectory is not dissimilar to Cam Norries’s, another Scot no one really expected to get as good as he did. And I guess this is a lesson for us all: everyone’s path is different. Coach Calv Betton messages in on Fearnley, saying he was having a middling college career in the States before coming big in his final year and he’s flown up the rankings – one of the fastest rankings of the last few years and not something anyone really expected. As a kid he was decent but not a standout and more of a grinder, but then he developed a rocket of a serve and last year kept winning challengers, so it should be no great surprise he’s melting a man who hasn’t played in two years. So far, Fearnley is too good for Kyrgios, holding to love to lead 7-6 6-3. He is handling himself beautifully. Alcaraz holds, forcing Shevchenko to serve for the second set at 1-6 5-4 while, on Laver, Djokovic is getting after Basavareddy now, outhitting him from the back to raise break point. But a backhand slice drops long, the kind of error you so rarely see from the greatest of all time and he’s left asking questions when his opponent’s mishit clips the line, facilitating a forehand winner. However Basavareddy, who’s had a fair amount of injury aggro in his short career, might just be flagging – there’s less pop on his serve now, and he’s soon break-point down again, saving it nicely. This is pressure, but it’s the kind of pressure he’s spent his life dreaming of, and a service winner gives him another advantage. This time, Djokovic nets, but you sense that the youngster isn’t physically ready to win a match of this ilk; we shall see. On Cain, meantime, Kyrgios – barely able to run – holds, forcing Fearnley to serve for set two at 7-6 5-3 while, as you probably assumed, Alcaraz has broken Shevchenko who was also serving for set two to lead 6-1 5-5. Excitement on Court as Shevchenko breaks Alcaraz then consolidates for 1-6 5-3 having taken four games on the spin; Fearnley holds against Kyrgios for 7-6 4-1; and Basavareddy fights back from 40-0 to 40-30, then allows Djokovic away with an exceedingly tame first serve and now leads 6-4 1-2. Kokkinakis has beaten Safiullin 3-6 6-3 6-3 7-6(5); he’ll now meet Jack Draper on Wednesday. For those who missed it earlier, Alex Michelsen, the surging 20-year-old American, beat Stefanos Tsitsipas – getting further from rather than nearer to a major title – in four. Watch out for him – especially given he now has the no 11 seed’s route through the draw. Fearnley consolidates in extremely short order, and looks a very accomplished player. Back on Laver, Djokovic, returned after his break, has held for 4-6 1-0 and it’s time for his new coach to earn his money; on Court, Alcaraz and Shevchenko have swapped breaks, such that the world no 3 leads 6-1 3-3. At 7-6 -0, Fearnley makes 0-30 on the Kyrgios serve; an ace follows. But a fine return from Fearnley helps raise two break points … and both are saved, the first via ace. But another excellent return earns another break point, and yet another opens the court for a forehand winner! Fearnley leads 7-6 2-0 and he might just be running away with this now! Kyrgios isn’t, it doesn’t seem, ready for this level of competition – physically or technically. …saved with an excellent second-serve into the body, though it’s surprising to see Djokovic fail to get it back. An ace follows, Basavareddy’s third of the match, and though Djokovic takes control of the next point with a backhand to the corner, he then nets a forehand and the young American leads 6-4! He is playing beautifully, and Djokovic, who leaves the court, knows he’s in a very serious match. Djokovic gets Basavareddy, serving for the first set, to 30-all, and when a hooked forehand lands wide a 20-stroke rally ends and here comes break-back point… But back to Cain, Kyrgios goes long, and Fearnley, making his debut in this tournament, takes the first-set breaker to three! Kyrgios spends change of ends ranting, but that was a really solid effort from the young Brit, who’s handling the atmosphere and occasion superbly. Arthur Cazaux, a hero of last year’s tournament, beating Rune and Griekspoor, has ejected another seed – Sebastian Baez is gone, 6-3 in the fifth. On Cain, meantime, Fearnley holds to secure a first-set breaker and quickly takes a pair of mini-breaks to lead 5-1; there’s so much going on and my ADHD is delighted. Djokovic holds to 30, so after a little sit-down, Basavareddy will serve for the first set at 5-4. Djokovic knows he’s in a match here and earns break point at 30-40, but Basavareddy outhits him from the back, enticing him to go long, and makes deuce. Then, when he reaches advantage, we see Andy Murray looking terse – yes, I know he almost always looks terse – and two tremendous forehands from his charge restore us to deuce. But then he goes long with another, his seventh unforced error of the match so far, except in a way all of them are forced because he’s being put under Benjamin Constant pressure. And from there, Basavareddy closes out, and at 5-3 he’s within a game of the first set! Fearnley and Kyrgios are now at 5-5 in the first; Alcaraz leads Shevchenko 6-1 1-1; Kostyuk has beaten Hibino 3-6 6-3 6-1; Golubic leads Mertens, who has a break in the second set, 6-4 1-2; and Auger-Aliassime leads Struff 6-3 6-0 2-3. Now then! Basavareddy breaks Djokovic to lead 4-3 in the first, and he is not waiting to be asked. I wonder if, perhaps, Djokovic’s aura isn’t quite what it was – opponents now feel that, if they play well, they can beat him. A colossal win for Draper, who came into this match having barely played in the last few months, but worked his way into rhythm and form to win a belter. He’ll be so much better for that and meets Kokkkinakis or Safiullin next, in what’ll be another taxing assignment. Draper opens what might be the final game of the match with a terrifying ace down the T, and though Navone responds well, a forehand winner curled into the corner makes 30-15. But when he comes in next point, he can’t get a cross-court pass up and over; naturally another ace on to the T raises match point at 4-6 6-3 3-6 6-3 5-2 40-30… Draper holds for 5-1 then Navone does likewise for 5-2, forcing him to serve for the match, just as Fearnley raises two break points. Kyrgios saves one with an exocet of a s second serve, then the other with a deft volley. From there, he closes out for 4-3 in short order, and this is brewing into a terrific contest. We’ve not visited with Djokovic yet, but the crowd are on their feet applauding the 19-year-old American, Basavareddy, who’s hitting it hard from the back and chucking in cunning drops too. They’re 2-2 on serve and this has the makings of a decent ruckus. Back on Cain, it’s a nice quiet night in at the library. Not! I don’t think! We’re on serve for now, though, Kyrgios up 3-2 and, as I type, creaming a forehand return cross-court for a clean winner and 0-15. Two gap yahs or not, few hit it harder and flatter. Fearnley, though, is handling himself well, securing a hold to 15 in impressive style whiole, on Court, Alcaraz leads Shevchenko 5-1. A booming forehand winner down the line earns Draper deuce, and this feels like the match here; that last hold will have hit Naovne like a heel to the solar plexus and shonuff he nets to hand over a point for the double-break. He plays a nice rally, though, forcing his man to stretch into a baseline backhand before laying a tasty drop … which Draper sprints in to flip back down the line for another winner! He leads 4-1 in the fifth and is nearly there. Alcaraz won’t have enjoyed being usurped as world no 1 by Jannik Sinner, and there’s a wild, vicious look about him out there. He’s broken Shevchenko for 2-1 and looks in frankly ludicrous condition, a hold to 15 giving him 3-1. Navone, complaining of a hip issue, necks some pickle juice and we’re back under way. Elsewhere, Fearnley, who’ll want to make this a tough, physical match, slams down an ace to make 30-all from 0-30 and closes out, while Draper, down two break-back points, incites Navone to go long on the forehand. A swinging serve out wide to the backhand follows, the lefty’s cheat code, and though the return is good, Draper runs around it then, a shot later, lands an inside-out forehand on to the outermost fibre of the outermost fibre of the sideline. That is a rrridiculous shot and from there, Draper closes out a colossal consolidation. He leads 3-1 in the fifth. Navone calls for the trainer, and before everything gets too much, let’s go around the courts to update ourselves on what’s coming to pass. Kokkinakis leads Safiullin 3-6 6-3 6-3 3-2 Hibino and Kostyuk are level at 6-3 3-6 1-1 Baez and Cazaux are level at 3-6 7-5 6-3 0-6 0-0 Auger-Aliassime leads Struff 6-3 6-0 Korda leads Klein 6-3 0-6 6-3 2-1 Draper makes 0-30 on the Navone serve, and when the Argentinian nets a forehand, you wonder if the physical and mental toll is telling. He’s reaching for his shots a little now, and when Draper defends the power-strokes, Navone loses patience, tries a drop … and nets again. That is experience talking and Draper leads 2-1 in the fifth with a break, saluting the crowd in celebration. A straightforward hold for both Navone and Draper while, on Cain, Kyrgios – who’s had pretty much two years off with injuries and accoutrements – warms up. On Court, meanwhile, Shevchenko holds confidently against Alcaraz, who looks shorn and mean with buzz-cut and vest. Righto, I’ve cunningly got Djokovic on Eurosport on SkyGo, allowing me another screen on Discovery+. As such, I’m now watching that, Draper, Alcaraz and Kyrgios. Anyone got any spare eyes? But first to Draper, level with Navone at 4-6 6-3 5-6 6-3. Navaone, for his part, has only ever won two main-tour matches not on clay, but is also the only player ever to make his grand slam debut as a seed. Anyroad up, both are back and off we go again, a final-set shoot-out – for those of us in the UK, a decent start to the working week. Greetings all, Daniel Harris taking over to discover an almost indecent quantity of tennis. Jack Draper has just levelled his match with Mariano Navone at two sets apiece; Nick Kyrgios will soon commence against Jacob Fearnley on Cain; likewise Novak Djokovic and Nishesh Basavareddy on Laver plus Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Shevchenko on Court; and there are various other matches in progress which we’ll discuss in a minute. Right, the daytime is officially over at Melbourne Park, which means it’s time for Daniel Harris to take you through the night. Catch you soon. Other names to look out for include Grigor Dimitrov (10), Tommy Paul (12), and Karolina Muchova (20). Second up on RLA is former champion Naomi Osaka in an incredibly high quality all-unseeded clash with France’s Caroline Garcia. While over at MCA, 2022 finalist Danielle Collins (10) takes on Ukraine’s Daria Snigur. Casting ahead to this evening, when Daniel Harris will be in the hotseat, there is a surfeit of high quality action. From 7pm on Rod Laver Arena Novak Djokovic (7) continues his love affair with Melbourne Park, seeded an unfamiliar seventh in pursuit of his 11th Norman Brookes Challenge Cup. Nishesh Basavareddy, a 19-year-old American wildcard gets a moment in the spotlight. At the same time on Margaret Court Arena, Carlos Alcaraz (3) begins his bid to pass the quarter final stage at the Australian Open for the first time. Kazakhstan’s Alexander Shevchenko is his first opponent. But the star power of those two serial winners might not be enough to direct attention away from John Cain Arena. “The people’s court” will be feral for the return of Nick Kyrgios, with the controversial Australian up first against Great Britain’s Jacob Fearnley. If you’re just tuning in, you’ll be pleased to know the weather has been glorious all day in Melbourne. No sign of the wild storms that interrupted day one. I missed out crowd favourite Thanasi Kokkinakis, who has just moved two sets to one up over Roman Safiullin, but the Australian is far from 100% fit. Of the matches still on court, Jack Draper (15) is two sets to one down to Mariano Navone, Marta Kostyuk (17) has conceded the first set to Nao Hibino, and Seb Korda (21) is locked at one set all against Lukas Klein. But the headlines at this early stage of a grand slam are generated by upsets, and there have been a smattering of those. The highest profile casualty is Stefanos Tsitsipas (11) with the out of form 2023 finalist unfortunate to come up against rising star Alex Michelsen. Jeļena Ostapenko (16) can also consider herself unlucky that she was drawn against 2020 Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic. The Swiss is a natural top-30 player but returning from maternity leave. Former champion Victoria Azarenka (21) was another notable early departure. British tennis has had a couple of reasons to cheer with Jodie Burrage winning the first match of the day, and lucky loser Harriet Dart prevailing in a third set tiebreak. It’s been a superb day for hosts Australia, with victories to Ajla Tomljanovic and Talia Gibson in the women’s singles, and Jordan Thompson (27), James Duckworth, James McCabe, Tristan Schoolkate, and Aleksandar Vukic, in the men’s. The top seeds in action today largely went about their business unscathed, but none of the likely contenders for silverware turned in memorable performances. In the men’s singles, defending champion Jannik Sinner (1) won his 15th match in a row in Melbourne, and 14th in straight sets, but needed a couple of tiebreaks to overcome Nicolás Jarry. While Frances Tiafoe (17) was taken to five sets by Arthur Rinderknech. In the women’s singles, Iga Świątek (2) and Coco Gauff (3) both won in straight sets without hitting their strides, while the impressive Jessica Pegula (7) dropped only three games. Thanks Joey. We’re in the evening valley here on day two at Melbourne Park, with the daytime stars already in their ice baths and the evening headliners an hour or so away from hitting the court. This gives us a perfect opportunity to wrap up the day so far and cast ahead to tonight’s action. But that’s just about enough from me for now. It’s been a pleasure having your company over these past four hours, with some twists, turns and a few upsets to keep you entertained. I’ll put you back into the capable hands of Jonathan Howcroft for now, with Daniel Harris on deck a little later. Koepfer put up a fight and Thompson’s serve began to abandon him as the set went on – his first save percentage dropping from 62% in the third to just 47% – but the German couldn’t find enough to deny the big serving Australian from progression. Thompson fired down 18 aces to five across the four sets while restricting his unforced errors to 41, compared to Koepfer’s 60. He’ll now face Portugal’s Nuno Borges in the second round. The women’s 16th seed is out, as Jelena Ostapenko goes down to Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic 6-3 7-6. The Lithuanian had fought back in the second set after being down 5-3 at one point but just couldn’t find a way to deny her opponent. The former world number four now moves onto a second round meeting with the Netherlands’ Suzan Lamens Jule Niemeier, meanwhile, was dominant as she stormed past Maja Chwalinska out on Court 14, the German dropping just a single game as she claimed a 6-0 6-1 win and set up a probably second round meeting with Ukrainian 17th seed Marta Kostyuk. Koepfer is not going quietly, breaking Thompson as he looked to serve the match out out on Margaret Court Arena. He then holds to love. There’s been a big response from Kokkinakis out on Kia Arena as he ties things up at one set all with Safiullin and on Court 13, another Australian in Vukic is in a fierce contest with Dzumhur and has taken it to a fifth set, where both belligerents have thus far held serve. Women’s seventh seed Jessica Pegula has got her campaign underway out on John Cain Arena, taking on Australian qualifier Maya Joint. On Court Three, Draper has made it a set apiece with Navone after talking out the second and on Court Seven, Schoolkate is inching closer to the second round, leading 6-7 7-6 6-1 2-2 as he battles with Daniel in the fourth set. Thompson is growing stronger in the fourth set of his match up with Koepfer out on Margaret Court Arena, preparing to serve for the fourth set leading 7-6 6-4 4-6 5-1. Down 6-3 5-3 and staring down the barrel of elimination against Bencic, women’s 16 seed Ostapenko has fought back in the second set on the 1573 Arena, taking it to a tie break. A near four hour epic has concluded out on Court Eight and, as the dust settles, it is Hungarian Fabian Marozsan that will be moving into the second round. Pushing each other to the limit, the world number 59 got past Brazilian Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-3 6-7 7-5 5-7 7-5 in the end, setting up a second round meeting with American 17th seed Frances Tiafoe, who also won in five sets against Arthur Rinderknech. When Harriet Dart wore up this morning she wasn’t even in the Australian Open -- eliminated by Japan’s Nao Hibino in qualifying. But Marketa Vondrousova’s late, late, withdrawal after being unable to overcome an injury picked up at the Adelaide International threw her a lifeline, a place in the draw as a lucky loser. And the Brit has taken advantage of her fortune, moving into the second round after getting past Croatian Jana Fett – saving a match point in the third set before triumphing in a tie break and taking the match 7-5 2-6 7-6. She’ll now face another Croatian in the form of 18th seed Donna Vekic, who cruised past Diane Parry in her opening round hit out. The fightback is on from Kokkinakis on Kia Arena, the Australian breaking Safiullin early in the second as he looks to tie things up at a set apiece. Out on Court Six, Pavlyuchenkova has taken out the first set against Yuan but now finds herself down an early break at the start of the second. Draper has raced away from Navone in the second set as he looks to bounce back on Court Three and on Court 14, Jule Niemeier has yet to drop a game in her meeting with Polish qualifier Maja Chwalinska, leading 6-0 2-0. Koepfer breaks Thompson to open the fourth set, only for the Australian to break straight back. As you were then, I guess. Schoolkate is doing his bit to set up a meeting with Sinner in the second round, leading Daniel 6-7 7-6 3-0 in the third set. As Sinner was seeing things out on Rod Laver, this late afternoon session has continued to prove a challenging one for the Australians at the nearby Kia Arena, as Safiullin has taken the first set against local hope Kokkinakis. Out on Court 15, lucky loser Dart and Fett have gone to a tie break in their third set, the Brit surviving a match point and breaking the Croatian to stay alive. “He did enough” is the word from Channel Nine’s commentary team as the men’s top seed moves through to the second round. He was made to work hard for it as he was taken to tie breaks in the first and second sets – and it easily could have been tied at a set apiece heading into the third set. But in the end, the Italian broke the back of his opponent’s resistance, grabbing the match’s first break in the second game of the third set and kicking away. No disgrace in defeat for Jarry, who rode the Chilean crowd to challenge his highly ranked foe and lived up to his status as the highest ranked player to play a top seed in the opening round of a major since Wimbledon in 2015. One final time, “Chi, Chi, Chi, Le, Le, Le!” More action in the men’s draw is underway, as Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka and Turkish qualifier Aziz Dougaz get things underway on Court 15. It all feels academic now as Sinner breaks Jarry again and can now look to serve this match out. The Chilean has tried to fire himself and the crowd up in an effort to spur a comeback but the men’s top seed has mercilessly ground him away. Koepfer continues to take it up to Thompson, holding serve and taking out the third set on Margaret Court Arena. The Australian fired down seven aces and hit more winners than his German opponent in the set but was let down by unforced errors, making 14 to Koepfer’s eight. Sinner is in cruise control now, speeding to another hold and now just two games away from the second round, leading Jarry 7-6 7-6 4-1. It doesn’t look like Koepfer is going to make things easy for Thompson and the partisan home crowd at his back over on Margaret Court Arena, the German qualifier serving to take out the third set. And in further bad news for the locals, Dzumhur has taken out the third set against Vukic on Court 13. Back on Rod Laver, Jarry ensures he still has a pulse by holding serve. The second round is starting to come into clearer focus for the defending champion, as Sinner holds serve to take a 7-6 7-6 3-0 lead against Jarry. Yet to break Sinner once, the Chilean faces a defining moment in seeking to hold serve. Casting our eyes out to Court Three, Argentine Navone has taken out the first set against British 15th seed Draper, taking an early 6-4 advantage as play begins in the second. Meanwhile, out on Court Eight, Seyboth Wild has successfully taken Marozsan to a fifth and deciding set. An unforced error from Jarry – charging to the net before sending his smash well over the head of Sinner – gives the match its first break. It’s now advantage to the Italian, as he’s gifted an early 2-0 lead in the third set and can now push to see this match out. Out on 1573 Arena, Belinda Bencic has taken out the opening set 6-3 against 16th seed Jelena Ostapenko – the defending US Open champ the latest to be put on upset watch. Admittedly, though, Bencic the Olympic gold medallist at the Tokyo Games and coming back after giving birth to her first child, Bella, last April, presents a pretty challenging opening round match. As it turns out, Sinner needed all three of those set points -- giving Jarry a sniff by coughing up two unforced errors, only to finally see off the Chilean and take out the set and extend his lead to 7-6 7-6. He can now see off the challenge from Jarry and move into a second round meeting with either Schoolkate or Daniel in the third. Fett has stormed back to take her meeting with Dart to a decisive third set, in which the two are currently locked up at three games apiece. On Court Eight, Seyboth Wild is serving to take Marozsan to a fifth set. Jarry hammers the ball into the net and gives Sinner three opportunities to take out the second set, two of which he will serve for! And there you have it, another tie break will be required to separate Sinner and Jarry on Rod Laver Arena. The cries of “Chi, Chi Chi, Le, Le, Le” ring out around the arena as the two prepare, the Chilean fans attempting to lift Jarry to something massive. The 29-year-old has never been beyond the second round of the Australian Open in four attempts and his best performance at a major was a fourth round apperance at the 2023 French Open. Another slate of matches have commenced in Melbourne. Lithuanian 16th seed Jelena Ostapenko is facing Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic on 1573 Arena, men’s 15 seed Jack Draper down an early break against Argentine Mariano Navone, Sebastian Baez and Arthur Cazaux are getting set to begin on Court Five, and women’s 27 seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has commenced her match with China’s Yuan Yue. And the day looks like it’s going to get even better for those in green and gold, as big serving local Thompson has taken out the second set against Koepfer, now leading 7-6 6-4. The Sydneysider is looking to move into a second round meeting with Portugal’s Nuno Borges, who has defeated Frenchman Alexandre Muller 6-7 6-3 6-2 7-5. You’re never going to believe this... but Sinner just hed serve against Jarry. I know, I’m shocked as well. It’s now 5-5 in the second set between the Italian top seed and his game Chilean challenger, with all indications we’re off to yet another tie break to split them. And then Jarry hold serve to make it 5-6. Because of course he does. Popular local figure Thanasi Kokkinakis has made his way onto Kia Arena to a warm reception as he prepares for his meeting with Roman Safiullin. And there’s been more joy for the locals on Court Six as James McCabe has seen of Spaniard Martin Landaluce in straight sets, winning 6-4 6-3 6-4. Indeed, it’s been a very good day for the locals, with Ajla Tomljanovic, Talia Gibson, and James Duckworth also winning through. In live action, Thompson can take a two set lead over Koepfer with a break, Tristan Schoolkate is down a set to Taro Daniel, and Aleksandar Vukic is fighting back against Damir Dzumhur. Jarry drops the opening two points of his service game against Sinner only to promptly fight back and take the next four, holding serve and roaring in celebration as he makes it 3-4 in the second set. After the first set went over an hour as it went to a tie break, both men have so far held serve in the second. Yep, we might be in for a long one… Novak Djokovic (7) against American Nishesh Basavareddy and Naomi Osaka taking on Caroline Garcia are also scheduled for Rod Laver Arena today. The Nick Kyrgios effect is in full swing, as hundreds of fans wait patiently outside John Cain Arena for the Australian’s long-awaited grand slam return. A failure in the virtual queue QR-code based system has forced organisers to return to physical lines to regulate access to the arena known as Melbourne Park’s “people’s court”. By 2.30pm lines were already hundreds of fans long, snaking in the sun at the eastern side of John Cain Arena. Fourteen-year-old Adelle was there with her friend and mother, anticipating a wait for two hours or more. “Kyrgios always puts on a show, he’s always good to watch, you know that at least you’re gonna get something interesting in there and he’s been out for a while,” the teenager said. The group had arrived at Melbourne Park at 8am seeking to reserve their place for both the day and night sessions, but were unaware the arena gets emptied before it is filled again for the evening’s matches. “I ran from the entrance into John Cain Arena and I got the seat I wanted, and then some people behind me said, ‘you know you’re not going to be here all day to watch Kyrgios, you’re going to get kicked out and have to fight for a spot’.” It’s been a distracting buildup for the Polish second seed but Iga Swiatek is through to the second round of the Australian Open after defeating Czech doubles specialist Katerina Siniakova 6-3 6-4. The former world number one didn’t have it all her own way, broken once in each set, but ultimately moved through rather comfortably, setting up a second round meeting with Slovak Rebecca Šramková. Former two-time champion Victoria Azarenka is out in a boilover! Italian Lucia Bronzetti had one just once in her two previous assaults on the Australian Open and didn’t enter this year’s tournament in the best of form but after winning a second-set tie break she’s taken out of the biggest wins of her career, eliminating the Belarusian 21 seed 6-2 7-6. Swiatek breaks Siniakova out on John Cain Arena and promptly holds serve. One more break and she’ll advance past the Czech doubles specialist and set up a second round meeting with Slovakian Rebecca Šramková. In other action, Portugal’s Borges has moved into the ascednecy over France’s Muller, taking out the third set 6-2. Gifted the opportunity to enter the main draw after an injury to former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova -- lucky loser has to be one of the better phrases in sport -- Britain’s Harriet Dart has taken out the opening set against Croatian qualifier Jana Fett. McCabe, meanwhile, has moved to a two set lead over Landaluce, up a break at 6-4 6-3 3-1 in the third. And with a powerful ace, men’s top seed Sinner is finally able to steal a march on Jarry, taking out the first set on Rod Laver Arena in an hour and 13 minutes! If this keeps up, we could be in for a long one, here. France’s Arthur Rinderknech pushed him all the way but 17th seeded American Frances Tiafoe has taken out their first round meeting out on the 1573 Arena, taking it 7-6 6-3 4-6 6-7 6-3. There’s a bit happening everywhere right now, as Thompson takes out the tie break on Margaret Court Arena to take the first set of his meeting with Koepfer 7-6. Siniakova, meanwhile, is hanging with women’s second seed Swiatek out on John Cain, breaking back in the second set before holding serve to make it 2-3. Sinner has a break point to take out the first set against Janny, twice, but he can’t take advantage! The Chilean has taken the men’s top seed to a tie break in their opening set, much to the delight of his vocal support in the crowd. “Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le!” Elsewhere, Thompson has held serve against Koepfer, forcing their opening set to a tiebreak. Siniakova, meanwhile, has stopped Swiatek’s run of breaks and made it 1-2 on John Cain. Tiafoe has taken what could prove a decisive break in the fifth set of his showdown with Rinderknech, looking to hold serve at 4-3 and take another big step towards the second round. The winner of that one will take on either Seyboth Wild or Marozsan, who are both seeking a break in the third set of their clash. There’s another Aussie in action this afternoon out on Margaret Court Arena, as men’s 27 seed Jordan Thompson faces off with German qualifier Dominik Koepfer. The pair have exchanged breaks in their opening set, with Koepfer holding serve to make it 5-6. Sinner and Jarry continue to search in vain for what could be a decisive break in their opening set on Rod Laver but that’s increasingly looking like it’s less and less of an issue for Swiatek, who has broken Siniakova’s serve for the third straight time to take out the opening game of their second set. Looking around the grounds, Alexandre Muller and Nuno Borges have taken out a set apeice as they battle in the third set of their meeting on Court 14, a scenario mirrored out on Court Eight in the match between Thiago Seyboth Wild and Fabian Marozsan. It’s break on break on break between Swiatek and Siniakova, as the Polish second seed breaks right back once more and will now have the chance to serve for the opening set. And she does! The Polish second seed holding serve to take out the first set 6-3. Duckworth isn’t mucking about out on Court Three, he’s taken out the second set against Stricker and now leads 6-2 6-4 heading into the third and what he hopes will be final set. Azarenka has broken Bronzetti’s serve as she looks to tie their match at one set apeice out on the Kia Arena, while the deciding set between Tiafoe and Rinderknech has begun with both men holding serve. Sinner is forced to sweat as he sees off two break points before holding serve against Jarry. Siniakova, however, has broken straight back against women’s second-seed Swiatek! Another Aussie in action today is wild card James McCabe, who has taken out the first set of his clash with Spanish qualifier Martin Landaluce 6-4 out on Court Six. And having just said that, Swiatek (2) has broken Siniakova to seize the initiative in their first set. Elsewhere, Rinderknech has been succesful in taking Tiafoe (17) to a fifth set, taking out the fourth in a tie-break and ensuring we’re going the distance on the 1573 Arena. Sinner (1) and Jarry have both held serve in the opening set of their match out on Rod Laver Arena, as have Swiatek (2) and Siniakova next door on John Cain Arena. Rinderknech is fighting back against Tiafoe (17), taking the fourth set into a tie break in his efforts to force their encounter on 1573 Arena into a decisive fifth. Out on Kia Arena, Bronzetti has held serve to take out the first set 6-2 against Azarenka (21), taking things out after a backhand error from the Belarusian. Out on Rod Laver, Sinner and Jarry have both held serve in their opening service games and now the top seed does so again for a second time: Jarry unable to keep his return in after watching an ace go past him the previous point. Another local hope in James Duckworth has made a strong start to his match with Swiss Dominic Stricker, taking the first set 6-2. Both have held serve as the second set gets underway on court three. We’ve another upset, as Chilean 23rd seed Alejandro Tabilo has been unable to survive a fourth set tie break and, thus, gone down 6-1 2-6 3-6 6-7 to unseeded Spaniard vet Roberto Carballes Baena In other action already under way, Victoria Azarenka (21) has broken back against Italian Lucia Bronzetti but still finds herself down 2-5 in the opening set of their match on Kia Arena, while American Frances Tiafoe (17) is on the verge of moving past France’s Arthur Rinderknech on the 1573 Arena. Another local has advances through to the second round on this second day of the Open, veteran Ajla Tomljanović taking the decisive set to defeat American Ashlyn Krueger 6-4 4-6 6-4. Thanks Jonathan and hello everyone, Joey Lynch here, ready to jump in after that barnburner between Tsitsipas and Michelsen, ready to take you through the next few hours of action from here in Melbourne. There’s plenty on tap but we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on men’s top seed Jannik Sinner, who is scheduled to get his campaign underway against Chilean Nicolás Jarry any moment and women’s second seed Iga Swiatek, who is facing Czech Katerina Siniakova – one half of the women’s doubles top seeds, alongside American Taylor Townsend – on John Cain Arena. And on that note, I shall handover to Joey Lynch for the next few hours. Catch you back here soon. Michelsen seals the deal with the first service hold in five games for the biggest win of his career. The 20-year-old withstood Tsitsipas’ comeback, and the partisan John Cain Arena crowd, to move into the second round – where a wildcard or qualifier await. Why is Tsitsipas struggling so badly? In short, his backhand has deserted him. He knows it. His opponents know it. And it is dictating every point. Michelsen is directing as much traffic as possible to his opponent’s backhand side, with the result of 15 unforced errors to just 4 winners. On the Greek’s forehand, it’s 17 winners to 10 unforced errors. Reminds me of Graham Gooch’s comment about New Zealand during Richard Hadlee’s time: World XI at one end, Ilford 2nds at the other. The standard of play in this fourth set is higher than the three before it with Tsitsipas liberated by his rage and Michelsen fighting fire with fire. Each man blisters the line with backhand winners, Michelsen pulls out a series of barely believable returns, and after three deuces, the 11th seed tosses in a double fault for a fourth consecutive break! The young American will serve for a place in the second round. A third break in a row and Tsitsipas is back on serve in the fourth set against Michelsen! The 11th seed has upped the intensity and Michelsen’s serve is wilting in the heat. John Cain Arena is hotting up! With Tsitsipas moving into all-or-nothing mode Michelsen hands the break back with a timid service game. The American immediately regains the break with a brilliant returning game, capped by a magnificent running backhand pass down the line to silence the partisan crowd. Two service holds for Michelsen and Tsitsipas will fall at the first hurdle. There is something happening everywhere you look around Melbourne Park now as the Australian Open hits its stride. Elina Svitolina (28) has won the opening set against Sorana Cirstea. Victoria Azarenka (21) is an early break down to Lucia Bronzetti. Ajla Tomljanovic is a double break up in the deciding set against Ashlyn Krueger. Australian wildcard Talia Gibson has completed her comeback victory over Zeynep Sonmez 3-6 7-6 6-1. She’s through to face 11th seed Paula Badosa in the second round in the biggest match in her career. … Michelsen, unfazed, has just broken Tsitsipas in the opening game of the fourth set. The Greek is rattled, mouthing off at his box and thumping his racket against his kitbag. The American is playing smart tennis, keeping the ball in play, executing high percentage points and allowing his opponent to combust. Stefanos Tsitsipas (11) is on the comeback trail! The Greek, with John Cain Arena well behind him, has won the third set to reduce the deficit on Alex Michelsen. The American won only two of ten points behind his second serve in the third set, allowing Tsitsipas the chance to dictate terms. I may have spoken too soon about Coco Gauff’s next opponent. Ashlyn Krueger has just levelled things up at one set apiece against Ajla Tomljanovic. Better news for another Australian though with Talia Gibson 4-0 up in the deciding set against Zeynep Sonmez. She didn’t sparkle but Coco Gauff did enough to see off Sofia Kenin on Rod Laver Arena. Both players were rusty, with Kenin hitting 14 more unforced errors than winners, and Gauff serving nine double faults. She has just spoken on court that her second serve suffered because of the glare from the sun. Great Britain’s Jodie Burrage up next. Diana Shnaider (12) has beaten Elisabetta Cocciaretto 7-6 6-4. The 20 year-old Russian is through to round two, where Ajla Tomljanović is likely her next opponent. Gauff survives a couple of break points to move one game away from victory over Kenin. It is a match has failed to catch fire with Gauff struggling behind her second serve and Kenin failing with a litany of low percentage attempted winners. Australian wildcard Talia Gibson has forced Zeynep Sonmez into a deciding set after pinching a second set tiebreaker. This is only the second grand slam match in the career of the 20-year-old from Perth. 25th seed Liudmila Samsonova is safely through in straight sets against fellow Russian Kamilla Rakhimova. Samsonova reached the semi-finals in Adelaide recently, and will face Olga Danilović in round two after the Serbian defeated Arantxa Rus 6-4 6-4. After grinding through the opening set, Coco Gauff is now a break up in the second and in control 3-1 against Sofia Kenin. Kenin has won just 46% of points behind her first serve and has 20 unforced errors to just nine winners. This undermines how much of the match has been played on Kenin’s terms, but so often a crucial forcing shot has landed fractionally long or wide, especially crosscourt forehands. On Rod Laver Arena Coco Gauff (3) holds onto win the opening set of her match against Sofia Kenin 6-3. On Margaret Court Arena Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic has taken the opening set against Ashlyn Krueger 6-4. And on John Cain Arena Stefanos Tsitsipas (11) is now two sets DOWN to Alex Michelsen 5-7 3-6. The first winner of the day is Great Britain’s Jodie Burrage. Burrage missed six months of the 2024 season through injury and considered quitting the sport, but used her protected ranking to start in Melbourne, and she is through to the second round after outclassing French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Next up for her: Gauff or Kenin. Coco Gauff has moved to a 5-2 lead over Sofia Kenin without yet hitting her straps. the third seed’s double fault count has grown to six, in just four service games. Frances Tiafoe (17) is a set and a break up in his match with Arthur Rinderknech. Zero unforced errors so far for the American. Another multi-deuce service game for Coco Gauff, but this time it goes Sofia Kenin’s way. We’re back on serve on RLA in a match already averaging seven minutes per game. Gauff has served five aces and four double faults in an erratic opening. Kenin is just keeping the ball in play and showing that resilience from the baseline that became her trademark five years ago. 20-year-old American Alex Michelsen has taken the first set off 12th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, breaking the Greek’s serve in the 12th game. It would be no surprise if the 2023 finalist became the first major casualty of the tournament. It took Coco Gauff eight minutes and five deuces to hold serve in the opening game of her clash with Sofia Kenin. We could be in for a long one on RLA. Great Britain’s Jodie Burrage has won the opening set 6-2 against France’s Leolia Jeanjean. The winner of that clash will face Gauff or Kenin in round two. Third seed Coco Gauff has made her entrance onto Rod Laver Arena ready for her blockbuster first round match against 2020 champion Sofia Kenin. Gauff won all five matches at the United Cup in Perth recently, without dropping a set, continuing her excellent end to 2024, that concluded with WTA Finals glory. Gauff is in Aryna Sabalenka’s quarter of the draw setting up the prospect of a mouthwatering semi-final towards the end of next week. Stefanos Tsitsipas reached the final here in 2023, and made three semi-finals in the four years before that. His form has nosedived since, plummeting from third in the world to 12th, with only two tournament victories in that time. He has the full throated support of Melbourne’s massive Greek community out on John Cain Arena this morning, but he has his work cut out against 20-year-old rising star Alex Michelsen who has vaulted from 601 in the world to 41st in just two years. It’s currently on serve in the opening set. Coco Gauff is in action in about 15 minutes, leading the charge for an emerging younger breed of US grand slam contenders. Since her much-discussed break with coach Brad Gilbert after her disappointing US Open performance (losing to fellow American Emma Navarro, who is the eighth seed in Australia), Gauff’s record is an extraordinary 18-2 since the US Open. With new coach Matt Daly, Gauff has ironed out much of the issues with her forehand and serve and is playing a brand of highly confident tennis. Further, the fact that Gauff is one of the fastest players on tour and possesses a very strong mindset makes her somewhat upset-proof in the bigger events. Today’s weather forecast is much more promising that yesterday. The temperature is in the mid-20s, it’s muggy but dry, and it should remain that way for most of the day. Any isolated showers passing through on the gentle southerly breeze are unlikely to linger for long. The most interesting story from yesterday’s play was the success of Hady Habib, the first Lebanese tennis player to win a match at a grand slam. Tumaini Carayol has more: Habib’s trailblazing success is even more significant considering it has come at a time of war in his country. The past year has been a period of unimaginable pain for many Lebanese people as the country continues to pick up the pieces following Israel’s airstrikes and ground invasion of Lebanon, which have killed nearly 4,000 people, destroyed whole towns and villages, and displaced more than a million people. With Habib’s parents, other family and friends still living in Lebanon, he has spent much of the past year glued to his phone every morning as he has tried to check that his loved ones were all OK. His success has provided an unlikely source of inspiration for Lebanese people. “It’s a huge win, especially what we’ve been going through as a country,” he said. “I think to bring something positive, especially, we’ve been having a rough time with the war. We had our other issues in the past. It’s just nice to get this win for Lebanon and for the people.” Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the second day’s play at the 2025 Australian Open. Action kicked off on the outside courts of Melbourne Park at 11am sharp local time, while the stadium courts welcome some of the sport’s biggest stars from 11.30am. I’ll be focusing on the daytime matches for now, ahead of a jam-packed evening session which features Nick Kyrgios, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Naomi Osaka. A selection of the first round singles matches we’ll be paying close attention to during the day session include: 11:00am: Stefanos Tsitsipas (11) v Alex Michelsen 11:30am: Coco Gauff (3) v Sofia Kenin 1:30pm: Iga Swiatek (2) v Katerina Siniakova 2:00pm: Jannik Sinner (1) v Nicolas Jarry Other names to keep an eye out for include a stack of home hopes: Ajla Tomljanovic, Jordan Thompson, Talia Gibson, James Duckworth, Thanasi Kokkinakis, Christopher O’Connell, Destanee Aiava, James McCabe, Tristan Schoolkate, and Aleksandar Vukic. While plenty of other interesting seeded players get their tournaments underway, including American challengers Tommy Paul (12) and Frances Tiafoe (17), rising British contender Jack Draper (15), and former champion Victoria Azarenka (21). There are also a couple of intriguing match-ups featuring unseeded players with serious CVs, specifically Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic v 16th seed Jelena Ostapenko, and Italian veteran Fabio Fognini v 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov. It’s going to be a job keeping up with it all, so feel free to nudge me in the direction of something interesting as it unfolds. The address is jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com for all correspondence. Hopefully today’s action is an improvement on yesterday’s thin gruel.

(155, 'politics/live/2025/jan/13/keir-starmer-labour-ai-yvette-cooper-tulip-siddiq-latest-politics-news-live', 'Starmer claims AI could lead to ‘golden age of public service reform’, even making services ‘feel more human’ – UK politics live', 'The Guardian', 'Politics', 'Government publishes AI opportunities action plan amid backdrop of economic uncertainty in UK', 'Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell have “decided to end our marriage”, the former first minister of Scotland has said. PA Media says: They have been married since 2010 but, in a post on Instagram, the SNP MSP said “to all intents and purposes we have been separated for some time now”. She wrote: “With a heavy heart I am confirming that Peter and I have decided to end our marriage. “To all intents and purposes we have been separated for some time now and feel it is time to bring others up to speed with where we are. “It goes without saying that we still care deeply for each other, and always will. “We will be making no further comment.” Murrell is a former chief executive of the SNP. Murrell was last year charged in connection with the embezzlement of funds from the SNP. The case has not yet come to court. This morning the Today programme broadcast an interview with Rupert Soames, president of the CBI, which shed some light on why some in the business world are losing confidence in Rachel Reeves. (See 10.51am.) Soames used to run Serco, the services company. (His brother Nicholas, the former MP, is a Tory peer.) Here are the key points. Soames said that he thought the chances of the UK economy growing by 2% in 2025, which is what the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting in October, was “very slim”. He said: The latest CBI forecast, we’re talking about [sub 1.5%, somewhere 1% and 1.5%]. I think what we think is going to happen, we think that the national insurance increases are going to feed through into inflation. So that’s not good news. We’re going to have a lower growth rate. Not good news. But also, because of things like the employment rights bill coming along, you’re going to find people laying people off and less likely to employ people to people. He said that, while he would not say business confidence in the government had “gone”, he would say it was “bruised”. As an example of why, he cited the experience of a company in Derbyshire that has been making since 1784 and employs 280 people. He went on: The combination of the living wage and the [national insurance increase] is completely wiping out their profits. No profits, and out profits they invest. So that is a real problem for them. And I think sometimes it’s not understood the extent of the increase, particularly on companies that employ lots of people. He said that, while businesses expected some changes in national insurance, they were taken by surprise by the lowering in the threshold at which NI kicks in. That would affect a lot of part-time workers, he said. He said the government should water down the proposals in the employment rights bill because currently they could lead to an “ugly rush” of firms getting rid of workers. A general rule in life is that when you find yourself in the hole, then stop digging. And there’s some stuff coming down the road for businesses, particularly around the employment rights bill – which is definitely going to happen – but the landing place that the government decides to adopt is really important. I’ve been in business 40 years, I’ve employed, been responsible for employing and hiring tens of thousands of people. I know a little bit about the psychology of people. And, as currently drafted, there are elements of the employment rights bill that are going to be powerful dissuaders from companies employing people. And when we have 9 million people of working age who are not working, the idea that it is not a priority to get them back into work … does not seem right. He said that there could be “ugly rush” by companies before the bill becomes law to let people go because of its implications. I think there could be quite an ugly rush before some of these things come into force where people actually let people go. He said the rules covering probabation periods for workers were particularly difficult for them. The things like the probation periods in the employment rights bill – we don’t want that to become an adventure playground for human for employment rights lawyers. With growth floundering and the Treasury at risk of having to announce further spending cuts, there has been some talk in the media about whether Rachel Reeves will survive a full term as chancellor. Yesterday the Sunday Times published a long article on this topic by its chief political commentator, Tim Shipman, whose work is viewed as required reading in most Westminster circles. Shipman did not seem to rate her chances very highly. He wrote: UK gilt prices are rising further and faster than in other comparable economies and many in the City think Reeves’s decisions since July have made the situation worse, not better. “She has lost credibility with the financial markets,” said a former Downing Street aide who now advises leading businessmen. “They don’t think she knows what she’s doing. They don’t believe a word she says. They don’t believe she has any idea how to fix this” …. In the City, they think [Keir] Starmer wants freedom of manoeuvre if Reeves is unable to salvage the situation. “The markets think Starmer will use her for the March statement and the spending review – all the tough stuff – then bin her,” the former No 10 adviser said. “I think they’re affording Starmer too much political nous, but that’s what he should do.” Shipman said Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, were both potential replacements, but he described Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, as the “firm favourite” to be the next chancellor. In an interview with Times Radio this morning, asked if he thought Reeves would survive as chancellor until the autumn, McFadden replied: “Yes, I do.” He also rejected suggestions she should be replaced, saying she had the support of Keir Starmer and the whole government. Rachel Reeves is the chancellor for a good reason, because she’s the right person to do the job. And one of the things I’d say about those kind of stories is when we won the general election, we won it as a team that was not afflicted by the kind of rivalries and personalities that had sometimes afflicted governments in the past. And we govern as a team and Rachel’s got the support of me, the prime minister and the whole cabinet. In an interview with Times Radio, Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, rejected suggestions that the government should try to halt the rollout of AI because of the potential impact on jobs. That would be like pressing the “pause button” on history, he said. At what point in history would you have us press the pause button? This is the story of historical and economic change. And we’re on the threshold of another huge one. And the country’s got to seize the opportunities from this. If we, again, follow the logic of your questioning, just try to press the pause button in previous history, then we’d never have become an industrialised country in the first place. The Tony Blair Institute, a thinktank led by the former PM, has welcomed the government’s announcement about AI today. Blair himself talks endlessly about the opportunities offered by AI, and he is evangelical about the need for the public sector to embrace them. Alexander Iosad, director of government innovation at the TBI, said: As the prime minister has made clear, AI is no longer an if, or even a when; it is here, and it is urgent. The opportunities for Britain’s economy and our public services are too great for us to ignore. This has to be the government’s priority. Public sector workers are overwhelmed and overworked, with many choosing to leave rather than try to make a broken system work. The result is a doom loop of growing backlogs, worsening outcomes and rising failure demand. The real impact of this is felt not just by those workers, but by the British public who can’t get doctors’ appointments, the benefits they are entitled to, and the high-quality education they and their children deserve. AI can help take care of drudgery in the public sector, freeing people up to focus on high-value tasks that require the human touch. TBI research shows that we can generate up to £40bn a year in productivity gains and savings, all while delivering better, faster and further. Blair’s thinktank is not always this successful at getting Keir Starmer to adopt its ideas. Three days after the general election, after Blair renewed his call for digital ID cards (another of his pet policy ideas), the government said no. The Conservative party responded to the government’s AI announcement overnight by saying Labour had no credibility on this issue because “shaping a successful AI future requires investment, but in the six months leading up to this plan, Labour cut £1.3bn in funding for Britain’s first next-generation supercomputer and AI research”. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, has been giving interviews this morning. Asked on the Today programme why Labour abandoned the plan for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University, he replied: The previous government did this all the time. They announced things with no money set aside for them. McFadden said the government would be investing in computing, increasing “public computing power by a factor of 20 by 2030”. He went on: The difference will be that when the Labour government announces this, we will put the funding to it. We’re not engaged in fantasy announcements with no money behind them. Michael Ellam, a former Treasury official who worked as Gordon Brown’s press secretary when Brown was PM, has been put in charge of the government’s bid to reset relations with the EU. Ellam left the civil service to take a job with HSBC, but the government has announced that he is rejoining the Cabinet Office as second permanent secretary, European Union and international economic affairs. In a statement, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for the reset with Brussels, said: The prime minister has set out a clear plan for change to improve people’s lives. That includes growing our economy and improving national security. Michael’s experience at the highest levels of international finance will be a huge asset as we work to deliver economic growth on behalf of the British people, including through resetting our relationship with the EU. In his Financial Times article Keir Starmer also includes an uncharacteristic ‘benefits of Brexit’ line as he explains that the UK does not need to follow either the US or the EU approach to AI regulation. He says: Britain shouldn’t just be excited about AI – it should be confident. We don’t need to walk down a US or an EU path on AI regulation – we can go our own way, taking a distinctively British approach that will test AI long before we regulate, so that everything we do will be proportionate and grounded in the science. And alongside that, an offer to investors of stability, pragmatism and the good sense they would expect from democratic British values. Again, this is different from the line Labour was adopting at the time of Rishi Sunak’s AI summit 14 months ago when Peter Kyle complained “the prime minister has been left behind by US and EU who are moving ahead with real safeguards on the technology”. Good morning. Today the government wants to talk about AI (artificial intelligence). It is due to publish its AI opportunities action plan this morning, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on the topic, and Peter Kyle, the science secretary, is giving a statement to MPs later. The main elements have already been well trailed. Here is the Department for Science’s overnight news release, and here is a story by Robert Booth summing it all up. As usual, though, what the government wants to talk about and what it will end up being forced to talk about are not the same. The macro story that matters most in UK politics at the moment is the rise in UK government borrowing costs (largely driven by global economic developments, and the prospect of what Donald Trump will do when he becomes US president next week), and whether this will lead to fresh spending cuts in the spring. On the business live blog, Julia Kollewe says UK bond yields (borrowing costs) are marginally up again this morning. The two stories are, of course, related. Rishi Sunak was also very interested in AI when he was PM and only 14 months ago he chaired a big, international summit on AI. The contrast is striking. Sunak was predominantly focused on the threat posed by AI, which is why it was an “AI safety” summit and, as it wound up, Labour issued a statement criticising him for not committing to swift “binding regulation” to impose safeguards on tech companies developing AI. Now Labour is in power, it is desperate to generate growth, and the announcement today is totally focused on what AI can do for the economy and public services. “Safety” does not seem to get a mention. (The 2023 AI summit also culminated with Sunak engaging in a slighty fawning Q&amp;A with Elon Musk. That won’t be happening again, obviously. The world’s richest man has now flipped from being willing to humour the person leading the UK government to trying actively bring to bring him down.) In an analysis, Dan Milmo explains why Starmer now sees AI as central to his growth strategy. Milmo says: “Low productivity has bedevilled the UK for years, partly due to low investment in nifty technology. AI, it is hoped, will help British workers produce more, which should raise wages and allow spare capital – you don’t need so many workers to do a certain job – to be invested elsewhere. This is even more important if, with an ageing population, the UK must cope with fewer working-age adults in the future.” Starmer is giving his speech later this morning, but he has already pubished an article in the Financial Times which is bound to give a flavour of what he will be saying, and in it he says AI could “usher in a golden age of public service reform”. The global race for AI leadership is fast and getting faster. Some countries are going to make AI breakthroughs and export them to the world. Others will be left to buy those breakthroughs and import them. I don’t believe government should be passive or neutral on this – this is the bread and butter of industrial policy. AI is the greatest force for change in the world right now. I am determined to harness it to usher in a golden age of public service reform. And I am determined the UK will become the best place to start and scale an AI business. I know growth in this area cannot be state-led. But it is absolutely the job of government to make sure the right conditions are in place. He also argues, counterintuitively, that AI could lead to public services becoming more human. [AI] offers credible hope of a long-desired boost in public sector productivity. Nurses, social workers, teachers, police officers — for millions of frontline workers, AI can give the precious gift of time. This means they can refocus on the care and connection aspects of their job that so often get buried beneath the bureaucracy. That’s the wonderful irony of AI in the public sector. It provides an opportunity to make services feel more human. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: The government publishes its AI opportunities action plan. Late morning: Keir Starmer gives a speech on AI. 2.30pm: Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Peter Kyle, the science secretary, gives a statement to MPs about the AI plan. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media.

In a statement, Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said: While we must continue to work for an end to the war (in Gaza), we must also work for a lasting solution to the conflict that guarantees self-determination, security and justice for both the Palestinians and the Israelis. There is broad support for a two-state solution, but the international community must do more to make it a reality. Representatives of more than 80 countries and organisations are expected to take part in the meeting, though no official Israeli delegation has been announced. Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, the head of the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa Philippe Lazzarini, and UN envoy to the Middle East Tor Wennesland are among those due to attend. Israel was angered when several countries – including Norway – decided to recognise the Palestinian state. Spain and Ireland also recognised the state of Palestine last year, while Slovenia has established diplomatic relations. Palestine is recognised by various international organisations including the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic cooperation. Most countries around the world formally recognise a Palestinian state. At its simplest, the two-state solution is the idea of establishing an independent Palestinian state that lives side-by-side with Israel. There would be two states on the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. You can read more about the two state solution in this useful explainer. Even though it is often touted by world leaders as the best policy going forward, it looks increasingly unrealistic in the eyes of many Israelis and Palestinians. There are reports of a deadly Israeli attack on the Salah al-Din school in Gaza City. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, said at least five people were killed in the bombing of the school, which was housing Palestinians displaced from their homes by Israel’s expanding war on the territory. The Israeli military have killed many people sheltering in schools over the course of the war, claiming they are targeting militants using them as bases – but this is heavily denied by residents and officials on the ground. Separately, there are reports of four Palestinian people being killed after a car was struck by Israeli forces in the southern city of Rafah. At least 46,584 Palestinian people have been killed and 109,731 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Monday. At least 19 Palestinians were killed in the last 24 hours, the ministry said. Gaza’s health ministry has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the US president, Joe Biden, spoke yesterday about efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Israel’s war on Gaza. Momentum seems to be building but uncertainty remains over key aspects of the potential agreement. The White House said Biden discussed the “fundamentally changed regional circumstances” following Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the rapid rebel offensive that toppled former president Bashar al-Assad in Syria last month, and the dilution of Iran’s power in the region after the Israeli military killed much of its senior leadership over the autumn. Netanyahu was reported to have updated Biden on instructions he had given to senior negotiators in Doha “in order to advance the release of the hostages”. Western intelligence services estimate that at least one-third of the remaining 95 or so Israeli captives in Gaza have been killed. About 250 people were taken hostage in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel, in which an estimated 1,200 people were killed. Sunday’s call between Biden and Netanyahu came as the head of Israel’s the Mossad foreign intelligence agency, David Barnea, and Biden’s most senior Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, were both in Doha. Barnea’s presence meant high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are now involved in talks. McGurk has been working on final details of a text to be presented to both sides. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN. “We are very, very close,” he said. “Yet being very close still means we’re far because until you actually get across the finish line, we’re not there.” An official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Monday that Qatar has handed Israel and Hamas a “final” draft of a ceasefire and hostage release agreement designed to end the war. We have not been able to independently verify this claim. Ceasefire talks have stalled repeatedly even when officials have expressed optimism about so-called breakthroughs. Netanyahu has been accused of delaying a deal for political purposes, possibly awaiting Donald Trump’s assumption of office on 20 January. Trump has said there will be “hell to pay” if Hamas does not release its hostages before he takes office, suggesting he is seeking a deal before the inauguration day. As my colleagues Lorenzo Tondo and Bethan McKernan note in this story, Hamas insists that any negotiations to secure the release of hostages must form part of a comprehensive pact to end the hostilities in Gaza, while Netanyahu is seeking a more segmented agreement, aiming for a deal that would see the liberation of some, though not all, hostages, while simultaneously preserving Israel’s prerogative to recommence hostilities against Hamas upon the deal’s expiration. Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has criticised the deal being worked out in Gaza, saying it is a “catastrophe” for Israel’s security and was a “surrender” to Hamas. Netanyahu has become more reliant on the support of Smotrich and other far-right elements of his coalition government – such as national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir – since the former defence minister Benny Gantz quit Israel’s emergency war cabinet in a row over strategy in the war and how to bring home Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Meteorologist Eric Holthaus has written for the Guardian and says the rain forecast for the next three weeks in Los Angeles means the city’s record-dry start to its rainy season will keep getting worse. This year’s rainy season is running at just 2% of normal for Los Angeles, which has only seen 0.16in of rain so far. Weather models increasingly indicate that southern California will receive no rain at all during the rest of January, and potentially no rain during the first week or two of February as well. That’s really unusual. January and February are the wettest months of the year for Los Angeles, averaging more than 7in of the city’s 13in of rain in a typical year. Even in the winter of 2006-2007, LA’s driest year in history, the city still received a little more than 3in of rain. Intensifying drought conditions mean that the current round of extremely out-of-season fire weather will continue with the resurgence of any moderate-to-strong Santa Ana winds. There are emerging signs in longer-range weather models that the current weather pattern could get sticky – and settle into what’s called a blocking pattern. If a blocking pattern, specifically a “Rex block” sets up, it would continue to shunt Pacific moisture either north into Alaska or further south into Mexico, worsening California’s drought. The Getty Museum is “confident” its art collections will be protected after fears winds could fan flames towards it and put world-famous works, including Vincent Van Gogh’s Irises, at risk. President and chief executive of the J Paul Getty Trust Katherine Fleming told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We try to be super-responsible stewards of global cultural heritage, and don’t take at all lightly the fact that we’re holding all of these treasures. “And consequently our facility was built to withstand the various things that this region tends to throw our way, earthquakes and forest fires or brush fires among them. So, yes, we’re certainly not cavalier or cocky, but we are confident.” Opened in 1997, the Getty Centre hails itself as a “marvel of anti-fire engineering”, with its exterior walls made of travertine and the building reinforced with concrete on the inside, PA Media reports. Fleming said the building also has “very sophisticated air circulation systems” because the main concern is smoke damaging the collection, and sections of the gallery can be isolated if one was to be breached. Images from the picture agencies have been flooding into wires services across the weekend. Here is a selection: Los Angeles residents have been speaking to the Guardian’s Kate Mishkin in Brentwood. One, Barbara Fishman, said: How do you decide what to take after you’ve lived in a house for 28 years and you have all kinds of things that you love and you have to take, you know, suitcases of shit? You just decide, I’ll take this sweatshirt, leave this one. I wear these shoes, I’ll lose those, whatever. I mean, the reality of it doesn’t set in until God forbid, like some of those people, they lost their houses.” Another, Aaron McNeil, was evacuated with his wife and two kids to a Culver City hotel. On Sunday afternoon, he was allowed to return to his home for more belongings. We have no idea when they’re going to lift the evacuation. So just since we’re at least allowed in right now … we just grabbed a few more essential stuff. We got our fingers crossed that the winds that are coming tomorrow and through Wednesday, I think, don’t whip it back up to what it was. On Sunday, LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from scorched neighborhoods. “There are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,” Crowley said during a Sunday morning briefing. “There’s no power, there’s no water, there’s broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.” Officials have warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. We would like to hear from people in the US about the impact of wildfires in and around Los Angeles. Have you been affected by the recent fires? How are you coping? We would like to hear about your experiences. Though we’d like to hear from you, your safety and security are most important. When recording or sharing your content with us, please put your welfare and the welfare of others first. Extreme weather events can be very unpredictable and carry very real risks. If safe, please get in touch here. After the death toll from the LA wildfires rose to 24 over the weekend, authorities predicted it was likely to rise as sniffer dogs conducted systematic searches in neighborhoods flattened by fire. Eight deaths have been attributed to the Palisades Fire and 16 to the Eaton Fire, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. The Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone has said 70 additional water trucks have arrived to help firefighters fend off flames spread by renewed gusts. “We are prepared for the upcoming wind event,” Marrone said. Fire retardant dropped by aircraft will act as a barrier along hillsides, officials said. Firefighters across Los Angeles County are bracing for powerful winds to return that could threaten new areas and block efforts to contain existing blazes. “There will be the potential — especially late Monday night through Wednesday — for explosive fire growth as those winds pick back up,” said the National Weather Service’s Ariel Cohen. “In the case of an evacuation order being issued, you have to follow that immediately. Seconds could save your life.” The US National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, warned fire behavior analyst Dennis Burns at a community meeting Sunday night. “It will kind of ebb and flow over the next couple days,” Burns said. “Tomorrow night, it will really ramp up.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the devastating wildfires that continue to rage in southern California, killing at 24 people people and displacing up to 100,000 from their homes. The fires, which are burning through an area larger than the area of San Francisco have destroyed thousands of homes, and reduced entire neighbourhood to ash. Here is the latest on what California governor Gavin Newsom says could be the “most devastating natural disaster in US history”. Firefighters are focusing on two of the worst fires in the county: the Palisades fire, which is 11% contained, and the Eaton Fire, which is 27% contained, according to Cal Fire, California’s department of forestry and fire prevention. Firefighters have had some success over the weekend, with the Hurst fire now 89% contained having destroyed 799 acres, while a fourth fire, Kenneth, burning just over 1,000 acres before it was brought under control early on Sunday. However, officials have warned that the Santa Ana winds could return, with Cal Fire, warning of “critical fire weather” through to Wednesday. In a post on BlueSky, CalFire said: “Life-threatening winds and dangerously low humidity are forecast for much of southern California – from Ventura to San Diego – creating a significant risk of rapid fire spread. The winds will cause increased fire activity.” The death toll has risen to 24, according to the Los Angeles medical examiner, although officials acknowledge it is certain to rise. At least another 16 people are missing, according to Los Angeles county sheriff Robert Luna, who said search and rescue efforts were ongoing. California governor Gavin Newsom said he will suspend a number of environmental laws to allow rebuilding across southern areas of the state destroyed by the wildfires. He said more than 50 teams of inspectors had been assigned to evaluate the damage, and hoped to complete the work in two weeks. At least 20 arrests have been made for looting. Among them were two burglars who posed as firefighters when entering houses, according to the police. Rob Bonta, the attorney general of California, has warned against scammers attempting to prey on victims amid the wildfires. Speaking at a press conference, Bonta said: “[In] emergencies like this, in addition to bringing out the best in so many, [it] also brings out bad actors who seek to use the trauma, the chaos of moments like this for their own gain.” Schools, except some in mandatory evacuation zones, will reopen on Monday, after closing for all 429,000 students in the Los Angeles unified school district on Thursday and Friday, Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced.

Rupert Soames, the chair of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), criticised the measures being introduced by the government. Sterling fell by nearly a cent, or 0.8%, against the dollar on Monday to $1.2111, the lowest since the end of October 2023 with the currency in focus after turmoil in the bond markets last week which piled pressure on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The dollar has surged to its highest since late 2022 against a trade-weighted basket of currencies as investors have adjusted to expectations of delays in interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve fuelled by strong jobs data on Friday. The euro also extended losses against the dollar, falling to its lowest level since September 2022. The single currency slid by nearly 0.6% and is now worth $1.0185. The rise of the dollar has added to pressure on the UK government, which has faced sustained criticism from lobby groups since raising taxes on business in Reeves’s budget in October. Soames said ministers had created “a hole in the confidence and trust that business has in government” after the tax rise and an increase in the minimum wage. Big businesses are also pushing back against the government’s employment rights bill, which includes banning zero-hours contracts and introducing protections from day one of a job. Soames also said that the government’s proposed strengthening of employment rights could prompt “quite an ugly rush” of job losses in the UK. “As currently drafted, there are elements of the employment rights bill that are going to be powerful dissuaders from companies employing people,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The government is bracing for more bond market turbulence, after a bruising week in which ministers felt compelled to respond to concerns that government borrowing could increase further as economic growth struggles. More borrowing tends to push up bond yields, effectively the interest rate paid by the government, as the debt becomes less attractive. The yield on the 30-year gilt jumped as much as six basis points (0.06 percentage points) to 5.472%, the highest since 1998 as investors sold off UK government bonds. It then eased back to about three basis points up on Monday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt also rose by about four basis points to 4.88%. Investors are concerned over a potential repeat of the experience of Liz Truss, whose time as prime minister was abruptly ended by bond market turmoil in the wake of a “mini-budget” by the then chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng. However, economists have said that conditions have not yet worsened that much. George Cole, an economist at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, wrote in a note to clients on Friday that “the size of currency depreciation on a trade-weighted basis is small relative to previous periods of gilt market stress”, and much of the move against the dollar has come “during a period of conspicuous [US dollar] strength”. However, he added that the “sell-off raises the stakes for upcoming data”, including on UK inflation.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/13/pound-dollar-cbi-hits-tax-changes-job-losses', 'Jasper Jolly', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6912ab458e5e500106bbddcbee7949da82d87da2/0_339_6285_3774/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 09:16:14', NULL, NULL),

Look for the good things – and build a bridge towards them', 'The Guardian', 'Life and style', 'We all have the capacity for creativity and growth. Hold on to this potential when life seems bleak', 'Something quite peculiar has happened to my Facebook feed, and I like it. (Yes, I am still on Facebook; I like to call it “research”.) One day, a few months ago, a post popped up from a group called Poisons Help: Emergency Identification for Mushrooms and Plants. I don’t know why the algorithmic gods delivered it to me, but I was curious, so I clicked. I saw a photo of a fungus growing on a tree stump, and a message from a panicked man whose dog was vomiting. Further photos showed the “vomitus”, including bits of regurgitated mushroom. Strangely, this was not off-putting. The owner, fearing his pet may have eaten something toxic, had come to the group seeking urgent guidance. And he got it, because the group members are vetted experts around the world, available in emergency situations to share their knowledge and, when possible, identify potentially toxic plants and fungi. In this case, they offered reassurance: the mushrooms were not dangerous. I now find myself reading post after post, each vibrating with love, terror, generosity, expertise, urgency, understanding, respectful debate, reassurance or advice to contact a vet immediately. And such gratitude! When cases are resolved and pets survive, the posters are so grateful to have had access to this remarkable free resource. It feels like a beautiful pocket of hope and light on the internet. And I don’t need to tell you, of course, that a lot of the internet feels pretty bleak. From trolling to extreme pornography, it can seem overwhelmingly awful, and getting worse. That’s why I like to get lost in this very specific and specialised corner: it reminds me that there is good out there too. It is easy to feel hopeless about humanity – especially in January. Trump (again), wars (again), the climate crisis and the destruction of nature (still), violence against women and children, poverty, racism, xenophobia, misogyny and homophobia (always): there is much to despair about. It can feel difficult to hold on to the reality – because it is a reality – that there are also good things happening in the world. For one thing, people who have studied and worked hard to become experts in their field are using their knowledge and skills to help others. This is something I see when I go to work in the NHS. For all the talk of its brokenness, all the cuts – sorry, “savings” – and the low staff and morale, every day my colleagues and I (in the clinic where I work and throughout the service) go into our consulting rooms and treat patients, and many of those patients grow and develop and make changes and get better. Some things get worse and some get better, and it is our responsibility to hold both of these things in mind. As well as facing up to, and standing up against, the bad that is happening, we need to hold on to the good. It is very easy to be overwhelmed by the bad, to lose hope and feel that that is all there is. And if you are a person whose home and family have been destroyed by war, or who is surviving a disaster linked to the climate crisis, or whose mind is ravaged by mental illness, it may not feel possible to see the good anywhere. But I think all of us can fall into that state of mind. It takes work to maintain our grip on the good in ourselves, in others and in the world. Now, this is not positive psychology, an optimistic, manifest-and-it-shall-be way of building a better life. I’ve written previously about gaslighting yourself, pretending everything is good. But if we can hold on to the good, and the potential for good things to emerge, we can lay the groundwork for more good things to grow. This was an idea that my rabbi spoke about in a sermon recently, talking about the Israel/Palestine conflict: that however devastatingly, traumatisingly far away peace may seem, we have to believe that it is possible, and behave as if it is plausible, so that we can begin building the bridge that may get us there one day. We can start to lay the bricks. I like this idea of laying bricks, beginning to build a bridge. It reminded me of my recent visit to the Natural History Museum in London, where I met James Maclaine, senior curator of fish. He led me into the collection stores of the Darwin Centre, which most visitors do not get to see: an enormous basement treasure trove with more than 27km of shelving holding millions of glass jars and tanks, some dating back hundreds of years, containing Darwin’s pet octopus, Archie the giant squid, platypuses, sharks and frogs. I like to imagine the Victorian scientists writing the spidery specimen notes and labels that would be deciphered by Maclaine more than 150 years later, laying the bricks for a fishy bridge from one generation to the next – one that continues to grow. Walking into that room made me feel quite emotional; James told me it made him feel excited – and that is why he is a senior curator of fish, and I am a psychotherapist. You don’t have to be a curator of fish or a peace activist or a fungus expert to start building a bridge. You can do it in your own life. When things feel bleak, you can try to hold on, somewhere in your mind, to the potential for things to get better. To remember that for all our capacity for destruction and inertia, we humans also have a capacity for feeling and thinking, for creativity and growth. You can start to lay the bricks for a better life, whether that’s through therapy, or a visit to a museum. You can see what is not going well in your life – and what within that is in your power to change. • Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author of When I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of Adulthood', 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/13/do-you-feel-hopeless-about-humanity-look-for-the-good-things-and-build-a-bridge-towards-them', 'Moya Sarner', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/92c966b3f074e2d5bcfd0b24c6bdea8aa8d5814f/1_0_5554_3333/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 09:00:09', NULL, NULL);

Control of both chambers of Congress is not uncommon for US presidents. Trump achieved a trifecta in his first term, as did Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. But Trump has an unusual edge over his predecessors: six of the nine members of the US supreme court are appointees of Republican presidents. Since the second world war, only two other presidents have assumed office with overall control of both houses as well as a supreme court “super majority” of two-thirds or more. Supreme court justices owe no official loyalty to a party or president, but a majority of conservative-leaning justices will work to Trump’s advantage. Here’s how these government majorities compare historically. Use the “Show party distributions” checkbox to reveal the exact proportions of control. What will be the impact of the supreme court’s conservative majority? William Galston, the Ezra K Zilkha chair in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said: “On the face of it, the president-elect will enjoy substantial freedom of action despite a very narrow majority in the House of Representatives.” But, he added: “In the past, many presidents have made the mistake of assuming that the supreme court is on their side.” Earlier in the 20th century, Scotus appointments tended to be somewhat less partisan. For example, Dwight D Eisenhower, a Republican, appointed justices who would go on to lead a liberal era on the court. “I have made two mistakes, and they are both sitting on the supreme court,” he purportedly said after his presidency. Also in 1952, at a time when all nine supreme court justices were appointed by Democratic presidents, Democrat Harry Truman was blindsided by a ruling that called his attempt to commandeer the US steel industry unconstitutional. Several rulings on the rights of prisoners during Republican George W Bush’s war on terror also imposed limits on presidential authority, such as Rasul v Bush and Hamdi v Rumsfeld. However in recent years experts have warned of an increasingly partisan supreme court. Data from the supreme court database reveals a 50-point gap between Republican and Democratic appointees in how often they voted for liberal results in 2023. In 2004, this was 25 points, and in 1984 it was 13 points. “This supreme court is further to the right than anything seen before,” said Galston. Recent landmark rulings on abortion rights, expanding second amendment rights and presidential immunity were all ideologically divided: six conservative justices voting one way; three liberal justices voting the other. The supreme court’s decision on presidential immunity also highlights its attitude towards the scope of the president’s executive powers. “We already know the current majority holds a very expansive view of executive authority. With this ruling, one wonders what fences the supreme court could put up against assertions of executive power,” said Ed Fallone, a professor at Marquette University Law School in Wisconsin. How might the balance of power change? Trump’s use of these extraordinary executive freedoms will face their first public judgment in the 2026 midterm elections. Recent history shows that presidents typically lose at least some control over government in the midterms. Of the last five presidents, all but George W Bush lost one or both branches of Congress to the opposition in their first midterms. It remains to be seen whether Trump will buck this trend, but his ambitious and controversial agenda, and an already tenuous majority in the House, will be factors when the elections come. In the supreme court, if any of the current justices retire in the next few years, Trump will get to appoint their replacement. He will be able to preserve the conservative super majority if he is able to replace the two oldest Republican appointees: Samuel Alito, who is 76, or Clarence Thomas, 74. Sonia Sotomayor, 70, is the oldest of the liberal bloc. Her retirement would let Trump further boost the super majority to seven out of nine.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jan/13/both-houses-and-a-supreme-court-supermajority-how-trumps-power-compares-historically', 'Ed Gargan', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/2040cf8fb515858f99f9511e8d823bbc83aff56a/1_0_4999_3000/500.png', '2025-01-13 09:00:09', NULL, NULL),

Then I volunteered to clean up my local park', 'The Guardian', 'Life and style', '‘Instead of sobbing in front of your computer screen,’ my counsellor said, ‘go out and do something’', 'There’s a pesky crisp wrapper half-sunk in the mud under brambles. Each time I secure it within the jaws of my litter-picker, another piece tears off. I persist, until all the fragments of coloured foil are in my bin liner. Then I move on. I’m volunteering with a group at my local park. They perform a range of tasks, but today – my first time – we’re litter-picking. “Aren’t you good?” passersby say, as they walk through the park with their takeaway coffees. Or sometimes: “You’re fighting a losing battle there, love!” When our bags are full, we gather for a break, in our fluorescent yellow gilets, drinking tea from flasks, munching apples and tutting over people hanging poo-bags on bushes when there are plenty of dog-waste bins. I arrived this morning on a knife-edge of anger and tears, but this simple, repetitive and collective act has soothed and distracted me from the perpetual doom-scroll of my mind. It’s easy to assume that the best way to lift your spirits when you’re feeling down is to do something nice for yourself. A hot-stone massage, perhaps? An online shopping spree? However, research suggests that altruistic acts work better. In one study, participants were assigned actions that benefited either themselves, other individuals or the whole of humanity; those who acted in the interest of others experienced a boost in positive emotions and psychological wellbeing, while those who were tasked with treating themselves kindly did not. I did not know this when I signed up with the conservation group. Nor did I know that volunteering is associated with greater self-esteem and better self-reported health and life satisfaction, or that helping others activates your brain’s “reward” system. What I did know was that I was feeling profoundly distressed about the ecological and climate crises. I was engulfed by hopelessness and helplessness, and I’d reached a point where, on reading that this glacier would have completely melted, or that species would be extinct, by such-and-such a date, I’d do the maths and think: “Good. I’ll be dead by then.” It was the counsellor I was seeing who switched me on to the idea of volunteering. As I sobbed in front of my computer screen during one of our online sessions, mumbling about turtle doves (the bird most likely to be the next extinction in the UK), he said: “Do something.” He gave me three rules: make it simple, immediate and collaborative. That’s how, a week later, I found myself in Victoria Park in Ashford, Kent, fishing old carrier bags out of the river. In subsequent sessions, our band of volunteers put up bat-boxes, created new paths, renovated the dried-out pond and surveyed for amphibians. Psychologists call the mental boost from volunteering the “helper’s high”. And boy, did I get high. Litter-picking turned out to be my gateway drug. I’d soon signed up to volunteer at a Sussex Wildlife Trust reserve as well, where we managed habitat for butterflies, built leaky dams and edged pathways with dead hedges. I’ve not stopped since. Every time I volunteered, I would come home bolstered by the fresh air, the natural environment and the company – and, perhaps most of all, by having acted in accordance with what I valued and cared about. “Volunteers who have strong needs to express and to act on their personal values may be easiest to attract and to sustain,” state the authors of a paper entitled Understanding and Encouraging Volunteerism and Community Involvement. I didn’t mind if the tasks we did were exhausting or repetitive. I was taking action. I was learning new skills – everything from how to use a saw properly, to how to distinguish between the song of a coal tit and that of a great tit. I felt part of something – something good. That’s not to say I didn’t – and still don’t – sometimes wonder: are we really making a difference here? Or are we just making ourselves feel better? I remind myself of something Isabel Losada writes in her book The Joyful Environmentalist: “Don’t be discouraged by people saying your actions are just a drop in the ocean. What’s an ocean except millions upon millions of drops?” That first foray into volunteering was four years ago. I’ve not stopped since. I used to think that people who volunteered regularly were either retired, or didn’t work for some other reason. But I soon learned that volunteers aren’t just people with time on their hands – they are people who make time for the things they care about. I moved to the Scottish Highlands in September. Do-gooder that I am, I was soon looking for opportunities to roll up my sleeves. I’ve tried to volunteer somewhere every couple of weeks – an afternoon here, a Sunday there. It’s been a brilliant way to meet people, as well as helping me to get to know my new environment. I’ve mostly opted for conservation work – a tree nursery that’s helping to restore the lost forests of the Cairngorms, a wild-cat reintroduction project – but the other day, I helped out at the local parkrun. “Thank you, marshal,” the runners said, one after another, as they passed me standing next to a large arrow pointing the correct way. You’d have to be fairly severely directionally challenged to go wrong here, but Aviemore parkrun always places a volunteer at this spot and the gratitude I received for being that day’s volunteer was humbling and uplifting. Later, I reflected on a paradox: while it was my total despair with human beings that led me into volunteering, it’s the goodness and kindness that I’ve witnessed as I’ve worked alongside my fellow humans that have kept me coming.

The polling, due to be published next week as part of the FGS Global Radar report, found that overall 14% of people agreed with the statement: “The best system for running a country effectively is a strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections,” rather than the alternative: “The best system for running a country effectively is democracy.” That rose to 21% of people aged between 18 and 45, who answered that the best system was a strong leader without elections. In contrast, only 8% of people over 55 preferred that system to democracy. The report’s findings, that a sizeable minority of under-45s are unconvinced by the need for elections, come as some electorates have been opting for populist leaders, such as Donald Trump, through the ballot box, and the billionaire Elon Musk has been wielding power over public debate by shaping what is seen on his social media platform X. Last week, the FT reported that Musk, who has been appointed by Trump to help overhaul the public sector, had privately discussed with allies how Keir Starmer could be removed as UK prime minister before the next general election, in a move that would constitute an intervention into British democracy. The FGS report polling found that men were more likely to lean away from democracy than women, at 17% compared with 13%, and Reform UK voters were fractionally more likely to do so than voters for other parties, at 17% compared with Labour voters at 16%, Conservative at 14%, Lib Dem at 9% and Greens at 8%. Despite last year bringing a Labour landslide, changing the government in the UK, and delivering a second Trump administration in the US, nearly one in four voters said they thought voting did not make a difference. Those most disillusioned with voting were aged 25 to 44, with three in 10 saying it made no difference. The survey found pessimism about the state of UK politics, with 47% saying: “None of the current political parties represent my views and values very closely.” From polling 2,000 adults of voting age, it found 23% think that “the UK is going in the right direction”, while 64% agree with the statement: “It feels like the UK is in a period of steep decline.” Fifty-nine per cent said they felt that “the UK’s best years are behind us”. The annual Global Radar report, which looks at the big themes of 2025, predicts that this will be the year of Trump and there will be a period of shock and awe while he delivers his agenda. In off-record interviews with 70 political experts and opinion formers, the report said they highlighted the fact that the UK is now a beacon of relative stability – compared with the last parliament and with the current state of play in major European neighbours – allowing businesses to plan, take decisions and engage. But many also predicted there would be inevitable clashes with business, trade unions and Labour backbenchers, with interviewees questioning whether the cabinet has the stomach for the fight. The report said that even the Labour supporters it spoke to were worried that the government was struggling to articulate its strategy and agenda, and concerned about a lack of a clear vision and narrative to explain what the Starmer government is doing, why it is doing it and who it is for. • This article was amended on 13 January 2025 to say that 59% said they felt “the UK’s best years are behind us”, rather than about one in six, as we had it in an earlier version.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/one-in-five-britons-aged-18-45-prefer-unelected-leaders-to-democracy-poll-finds', 'Rowena Mason Whitehall editor', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/855e51c9c3a06d78865f9ece7806e5d7c1a506b9/0_117_3772_2263/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 09:59:04', NULL, NULL),

More than 15,800 readers donated to the appeal, which closed at midnight on Sunday evening. It was the highest sum raised by the annual appeal since 2016 and the 10th successive year that readers have given more than £1m. The money raised will benefit three charities: Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and War Child, which carry out frontline medical aid work in war zones, and Parallel Histories, which helps schools teach sensitive and controversial histories such as those of Northern Ireland as well as Israel and Palestine. The inspiring work of our three partner charities has been featured in a series of articles, a short film and a Today in Focus podcast over the past few weeks. Hundreds of readers have left email messages of support via the online donation page. One reader said: “I have no lived experience of war, and so my small donation is my way of saying I care, you do matter, and I’d like to help in a very small way to change something for someone somewhere.” Another said: “My heart goes out to those caught up in the horror that is war. Anything that anyone can do to help those people is a drop in the ocean but at least something. My heartfelt thanks to those who are doing something.” One emailed to say: “It’s so important that we do all we can to stand with people, to show we care and can act for peace, humanity and for young lives to have a future.” Our partner charities paid tribute to readers for their generosity. Dr Natalie Roberts, executive director of MSF UK, said: “Thank you to Guardian and Observer readers who have donated to this appeal. At MSF, we fully rely on support from private donors to continue our work in the most challenging circumstances. “Thanks to you, we will be able to continue to respond quickly to medical emergencies in conflict situations and deliver life-saving and life-changing care to people where it’s needed most.” Helen Pattinson, chief executive of War Child UK, said: “This year’s appeal has raised a staggering amount of money to support our work at War Child, and we couldn’t be more grateful to the Guardian, Observer, and their readers for every penny donated. “Thanks to everyone who has generously supported the appeal, we will continue to provide both psychological health support and immediate emergency aid to children and their families that desperately need it, always keeping in mind our ultimate goal – ensuring a safe future for every child living through war.” Bill Rammell, chief executive of Parallel Histories, said: “Reader’s contributions have made a real difference to Parallel Histories – your generosity will enable more young people to navigate our divided world, contribute to civic society, and develop their critical thinking, oracy skills and confidence. He added: “It will help Parallel Histories develop and expand our work in schools teaching and debating contested history. Enabling young people to understand conflict and through building their empathy and understanding, equipping them to contribute to resolving conflict.” The provisional total for the 2024 appeal, inclusive of estimated gift aid, was £1,735,000.

The death toll from the Eaton and Palisades fires that have consumed large swathes of Los Angeles county – and are still less than 30% contained – has risen to 24 people. Officials in California warned on Sunday that strengthening winds through Wednesday threaten to expand the destruction. The city has already seen neighborhoods erased and thousands of structures destroyed. Kristin Crowley, LA fire chief since 2022, has publicly criticized the city for budget cuts that she said have made it harder for firefighters. She blamed the city for water running out on Tuesday. About 20% of the hydrants tapped to fight the Palisades fire went dry. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said he would suspend a number of environmental laws to allow rebuilding across southern areas of the state destroyed by the wildfires. What’s the latest on the firefighting efforts? The Palisades fire is 11% contained; the Eaton Fire, 27%, officials said. What risk do the winds pose? The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50mph and mountain gusts reaching 70mph. Steve Bannon says Elon Musk is ‘racist’ and ‘truly evil’ as Maga rift deepens Donald Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon has called the incoming president’s newest favorite, Elon Musk, “racist” and a “truly evil guy”, pledging to “take this guy down” from the Maga movement. It marks a deepening of discontent among the high-profile figures in the American far right, days before Trump begins a second term on 20 January. The feud is partly related to Musk’s embrace of H-1B visas, which allow companies – such as Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla – to hire skilled foreign professionals, which has been taken badly by some Maga acolytes who oppose nearly all immigration. Musk, born in South Africa, once had an H1-B. What did Bannon say? Musk “is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down,” he told an Italian newspaper. “Before, because he put money in, I was prepared to tolerate it – I’m not prepared to tolerate it any more.” He added: “I will have Elon Musk run out of here by inauguration day.” What about Musk? At time of writing, the usually vocal Musk has been conspicuously silent on Bannon’s comments on X. Joe Biden and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke on Sunday by phone about efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Israel’s war on Gaza. The White House said the president discussed the “fundamentally changed regional circumstances” following Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the rapid rebel offensive that toppled former president Bashar al-Assad in Syria last month and the dilution of Iran’s regional power. Momentum for a ceasefire deal seems to be building, but uncertainty remains over key aspects of the potential agreement. What is the latest with the Israeli hostages? Western intelligence services estimate that at least a third of the remaining 95 or so Israeli captives in Gaza have been killed, after about 250 people were taken hostage in the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks. In other news … Syria’s new rulers have invited Bashar al-Assad-era security officials to turn themselves in, in centers where they receive slips of paper saying they have officially surrendered and reconciled with the new administration. The Swedish prime minister said his Nato-member country is neither at war nor at peace, as he announced sending armed forces into the Baltic Sea amid suspected sabotage of undersea cables. George Orwell will be honored in the UK with a new £2 coin ($2.44), to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the author’s death. Biden criticized Meta’s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, calling the decision to replace Facebook fact-checking with community notes “really shameful”. Stat of the day: Gaza death toll 40% higher than official number, study in the Lancet finds Research published in the Lancet medical journal estimates that the death toll in Gaza during the first nine months of war was about 40% higher than estimated. Academics at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, Yale University and other institutions found, from 7 October 2023 to 30 June 2024, there were 64,260 people killed due to traumatic injury by Israel’s bombardment, rather than 37,877 then-estimated by Gaza health officials.

Toscani, who for two decades was the art director of the global clothing chain, died on Monday after being hospitalised close to his home in the Tuscan town of Cecina. The Milan-born photographer told Corriere della Sera newspaper in August last year that he had a terminal illness and did not know how long he had to live. “With great sadness we announce that today, January 13, 2025, our beloved Oliviero has embarked on his next journey,” his family said in a statement on Instagram. “We kindly ask for discretion and understanding at this time.” Toscani worked for prominent fashion magazines throughout his career including Elle, Vogue, GQ and Harper’s Bazaar, photographing John Lennon, Andy Warhol and the Italian film director Federico Fellini along the way. But he was best known for images that drew attention to social themes, ranging from HIV/Aids and racism to the death penalty and mafia killings, in the United Colours of Benetton advertising campaigns, mostly in the 1980s. The most controversial was his use of a photograph of David Kirby, who had Aids, on his deathbed, surrounded by his family, for a 1992 Benetton campaign during the peak of the health crisis in the US. Other provocative photos included a kiss between a priest and a nun, the faces of men on death row, a black woman breastfeeding a white child and a still-bloody newborn baby with umbilical cord attached. Toscani’s work was applauded and reviled, provoking consumer backlashes and boycotts of Benetton, with some of the fashion brand’s advertising campaigns censored in Italy and France. He also courted controversy with his 2007 photograph for the fashion brand Nolita of the model Isabelle Caro, who had severe anorexiaand was pictured nude. She later died of the disease. The image, timed to run in line with Milan fashion week, was displayed on billboards with “No Anorexia” over the photo. In an interview in 2016 with a photography blog, Toscani said companies had a responsibility to “show [their] social intelligence and sensitivity to the society” around them. On Monday, Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, said Toscani had left “an indelible mark” on the world of photography and communication. “His photos and campaigns provoked and made us think,” he added. Parliamentarians for the Five Star Movement paid tribute to a “visionary and courageous talent” who knew how to “transform photography into a powerful tool for social reflection”. “With courage and creativity, he challenged convention, breaking patterns and opening new horizons in the world of art and advertising. His visionary talent will continue to inspire future generations.” Benetton broke ties with Toscani in 2020 after dismissive comments he made about the 2018 bridge collapse in Genoa that killed 43 people. The Benetton family was the main shareholder of the company that managed the bridge at the time of the disaster. Before his death Toscani had said he was suffering from amyloidosis, in which abnormal protein deposits develop in the body.

On Saturday he confirmed Khvicha Kvaratskhelia wants to leave Napoli, expressing frustration that six months of working together had not persuaded the Georgia international that they could achieve great things together. A day later, though, he provided a subtle reframing. “I want to underline something,” said Conte at his press conference following a 2-0 win over Verona. “When I spoke about disappointment, I was not speaking about disappointment felt toward a player or toward the club but in myself. I thought I could cut through and influence this situation … maybe I was a little bit presumptuous.” After winning league titles with three clubs across two countries, Conte can feel entitled to his self-belief. He has reminded us again this season at Napoli of his extraordinary capacity to bend a situation to his will, lifting a team that finished 10th last season back to the top of the Serie A table. Sunday’s victory was another little landmark to remind us of how quickly he has turned this club around. Napoli began this season with a 3-0 loss away to Verona, an inauspicious start even before we remember Kvaratskhelia left that game with an injury before half-time. The winger’s presence had helped lure Conte to Napoli in the first place – a guarantee of continuity even as the other star of the 2022-23 title-winning side, Victor Osimhen, was expected to depart. “I’ve heard some confusion on this subject, but there is none,” said Conte upon taking his position in June. “Kvaratskhelia is staying. I have been categorical on this point.” Despite failing to find a buyer for Osimhen – eventually sent on loan to Galatasaray – Napoli pressed ahead with their own spending plans, adding Alessandro Buongiorno, Scott McTominay, Romelu Lukaku, David Neres, Billy Gilmour and Rafa Marín. Their combined fees added up to almost €150m. Still, Kvaratskhelia was key to all of it. “He has characteristics that just aren’t common,” said Conte. “He’s strong, he has that bit of fantasy, he creates goal-scoring opportunities and assists. We want to draw out the best of what makes him special.” The player was making the right noises too, describing Conte as “one of the best in the world” and a coach who could aid his personal development. In the background, though, were contradicting remarks from his agent Mamuka Jugeli, who told Sport Imedi in June that Kvaratskhelia wanted to leave and to compete in the Champions League. With the player’s contract running through to 2027, and still set at the same modest rate he agreed when joining from Dinamo Batumi – his reported €1.8m annual net salary is less than a third the figure paid to Lukaku – the expectation was that he would follow Osimhen’s path of agreeing a new deal on improved terms with clauses to guarantee mutually convenient sale at a later date. Perhaps the Nigerian’s failure to find a club this summer dissuaded Kvaratskhelia. Or maybe Conte’s ideas have not truly resonated in the way the manager imagined. On the surface this has been another solid season for Kvaratskhelia, who has five goals and three assists in 15 Serie A starts. Yet there are peculiarities. He is beating his man far less regularly than in previous seasons, WhoScored’s numbers showing just 1.1 successful dribbles per game, compared to three last term. It is not for lack of trying. Fotmob puts his success rate at just 31.1% this season, down from above 50 last term. Part of the explanation may be tactical. Conte’s Napoli have evolved through the season, abandoning a back three and progressing through what he characterised as a 4-2-2-2 to something more like a 4-3-3. But there has sometimes been an emphasis on playing down the right, a tendency that can leave Kvaratskhelia isolated on the left. Another theory has been that Conte’s more physically demanding playing style and insistence on tracking back is sapping explosiveness at the other end. Whatever the reason, there has been a growing sense for Napoli that Kvaratskhelia might not be as indispensable as he once was. Neres had only started five games before this weekend, but already had collected two goals and four assists, several of those while filling in on the left. Saturday’s game was the fifth time Kvaratskhelia has been missing from the starting XI this season, and the third time he has been absent for the full 90 minutes. Napoli have won on every occasion. Neres was a menace, constantly on the ball and taking up threatening positions in the first half, especially. He deserved an assist for the feint that floored Ondrej Duda in the Verona box after half an hour, but McTominay fired over from his pass. No matter. Napoli had already taken the lead in the fifth minute, when captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo executed a brilliant one-two with Lukaku on the edge of the area before swinging a shot against the post, from where it rebounded on to the back of goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipò and into the net. It took them until the hour mark to get their second goal. Lukaku was the pivot again, this time for André-Frank Zambo Anguissa, who crashed his shot in at Montipò’s near post. Even before that, though, Napoli had never looked in danger of letting things slip. As a one-off result, the win was nothing remarkable. Verona are 17th, having conceded 44 goals in 20 games. Yet Napoli’s consistency, even without their most technically gifted player, is impossible to ignore. Their 47 points so far are only six fewer than they collected in the entire 2023-24 campaign. Inter, who won away to Venezia on Sunday, can still overtake them if they win their two games in hand. But with more than half the season gone, Napoli have occupied first place at the end of more than half of the rounds. We will learn more about Kvaratskhelia’s future in the coming days. In his remarks over the weekend, Conte made it clear he will not resist the player’s sale, saying he could not keep a player “in chains”. But he did add that: “For now, he is a Napoli player. There are steps to take if any team wants to buy him.” There will be no shortage of suitors. Paris Saint-Germain were presumed front-runners, but Conte’s remarks have likely encouraged more clubs to enquire and Napoli’s owner Aurelio De Laurentiis, famously stubborn about not letting players leave for less than he thinks they are worth, is unlikely to discourage a bidding war. The most shocking element might be how undaunted Napoli, and Naples, appear. This is not just any player but the one they rechristened as “Kvaradona”, heir to Diego and star of their first Scudetto-winning team for 33 years. A man to whom many murals have been dedicated about the city. There will be sadness, and no small measure of bitterness about his choice to leave in the middle of a title push, a choice which will never be forgotten. But Conte’s impact has been such that a fanbase who hold tight to all past glories might keep their focus in this optimistic present instead. “We’re up high right now, and we’ll try to stay there,” he said on Sunday, doing his best to deflect more title talk. “I don’t know what it means that we are up so high, but I know we are annoying people, because there are some now who are worried about Napoli. Losing important players is never nice, but we’ll see what happens in the future. We are ready for whatever comes.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/13/napoli-serie-a-khvicha-kvaratskhelia-antonio-conte', 'Nicky Bandini', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/edff5039ae9866618bfec4ddc844c139be7704ff/0_0_5568_3341/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 10:23:52', NULL, NULL),

After all, I’ve been reviewing battery-powered gadgets for more than a decade, and I have all 32 teeth and a comfortable toothpaste budget, which makes me as qualified as anybody else. Or does it? Actually, in the absence of professional toothbrushing leagues*, how would I know if I’m an expert in the art of oral hygiene or not? Conventional (and, as it turns out, likely bogus) wisdom suggests that anyone can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. By this metric, brushing twice for a total of four minutes daily, you would finally reach enlightenment during your 411th year, at which point you’d probably have more pressing medical concerns than oral hygiene. While it’s nice to put my comparatively young age into perspective, it was clear I needed a bit of guidance on the art and science of teeth brushing. So I got on a call with Bupa Dental Care’s head of hygiene and therapy, Caitlin Miller. First of all, are electric toothbrushes actually better? In short, yes. While you can get the same results with a manual toothbrush, most people won’t – or not without spending a lot longer at the sink anyway. “There are people who can do a perfectly good job with a manual brush, but for the majority of my patients, I will see improvements when people go on to an electric toothbrush,” says Miller. So, what should you look for when going electric? A pressure sensor is the main feature, as counterintuitively, pushing too hard dampens the vibrations and the bristles, weakening performance. Thankfully, most electric toothbrushes now have this as standard. “Slightly more fancy ones have a pressure sensor that tells you if you’re brushing too softly as well as too hard or just right,” Miller says. She’d also recommend a built-in timer for the full two minutes, and a sensitive setting, because sore gums and mouth ulcers are a thing, and you still need to brush daily. Reassuringly, none of these things are exclusive to those intimidatingly priced top-end toothbrushes with prices rivalling smartphones. An £800 device should get similar results to a £100 one if you brush right, in other words. And how does one brush right? “You want to hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle – half on the gum, half on the tooth,” Miller says. “You should be holding it horizontally, sweeping across the tooth and gum margins. “You don’t move it up and down, or round and round. That’s the beauty of the electric toothbrush: you can be pretty lazy with it and it still does a good job.” That laziness should also extend to your movements, keeping the brush on each tooth for a couple of seconds. And when you’re done, you should keep the toothpaste in your mouth (“Spit not rinse is what we say”). As for changing heads, this should be done every three months, but sooner if they’re looking splayed or frayed – or if you’ve been ill lately because they can harbour bacteria for a surprisingly long time. It turns out that being a pro toothbrusher isn’t that hard after all – now I kind of wish there were professional leagues. Having used a whole lot of toothbrushes over the past few months, I’m not short of experience, even if my toothpaste expenditure will have to rise to match the new hobby. * To avoid looking silly, I did Google this, and all I found was a bunch of horribly creepy AI-generated images of a fictional contest.

(200, 'football/2025/jan/13/harry-maguire-arsenal-penalty-need-var-manchester-united-zirkzee', 'Harry Maguire declares Arsenal penalty award shows why ‘we need’ VAR', 'The Guardian', 'Football', 'Manchester United’s Harry Maguire has suggested video assistant referees are essential to the modern game after the penalty he conceded against Arsenal', 'Harry Maguire has suggested video assistant referees are essential to the modern game, pointing to the controversial penalty that Arsenal won against him and his Manchester United team on Sunday to drive the argument. Maguire was stunned to be penalised by the referee, Andrew Madley, in the 69th minute of the FA Cup third-round tie with the score at 1-1 and United down to 10 men after Diogo Dalot’s red card. The central defender had stood his ground against the Arsenal striker Kai Havertz, putting out an arm at worst only to watch his opponent tumble to the ground. VAR is not in use in the early rounds of the competition – it comes in from the fifth round onwards. “It’s a tough one,” Maguire said, when asked if it was the worst penalty decision he had seen. “At the time when he gave it … my initial instinct was that it will be all right, VAR will turn it over and then I clicked on in my head that VAR could not intervene. So that’s when my head went a little bit. “He [Madley] probably looks back … he knows he got it wrong. That’s why we have VAR because in the big moments, we need them correct and it’s a tough gig if we don’t have help for them [referees].” Altay Bayindir saved the ensuing spot-kick from Arsenal’s captain, Martin Ødegaard, before United eventually advanced on penalties, Joshua Zirkzee converting the winner to complete a near-perfect redemptive arc – one to which Maguire could certainly relate. Zirkzee was cheered off the field by the Old Trafford crowd when substituted in the 33rd minute of the 2-1 defeat by Newcastle on 30 December; the striker had been unable to do anything right in what was up to that point an abject collective display. Maguire knows how it feels to be ridiculed by fans, including his own. His substitution towards the end of United’s Champions League exit against Atlético Madrid in March 2022 was cheered by a section of the Old Trafford support. It was one of the lows of the most difficult season of Maguire’s career, which would be followed by the lost campaign of 2022-23 when he sank to the bottom of United’s central defensive pecking order. The player’s fightback after a tough start to last season has won him a lot of respect; there was another detail to it on 3 January when United triggered the one-year option in his contract to tie him down until the summer of 2026. One of the takeaways from the Arsenal Cup tie was the love that United’s away fans showered on Zirkzee after he came on as an 81st-minute substitute. It was rooted in characteristic defiance and there were signs of a reconnection from Zirkzee’s point of view even before he scored his penalty. He had turned towards the travelling support after the end of extra time to gee them up. “I’ve had a time for this club where things are tough and everyone seems to come against you,” Maguire said. “But one thing’s for sure is that the United fans stick with you. When times were tough they stuck with me. “That game against Newcastle … he [Zirkzee] was the unfortunate one to get subbed off. You could have subbed any of the 11 players off at that moment and they would have all got booed – we all deserved to get booed because we were awful in the first 30 minutes. “It had nothing to do really with Josh. He probably knows that and he probably felt it at the time, even though it was disappointing for him. It’s a great ending that he scores the winning penalty and the lads had full faith in him that he would do.” The win over Arsenal continued a trend for United under Ruben Amorim: the capacity to be competitive against the very top teams away from home. Although they lost 2-0 at the Emirates in the Premier League, they won 2-1 at Manchester City and drew 2-2 at Liverpool. The problem has been the focus against plenty of other clubs and Maguire knows there will be scrutiny on the mentality when bottom-of-the-table Southampton visit on Thursday. “Our consistency this year has been really, really poor,” Maguire said. “We can produce moments. We produced a moment in the FA Cup final last year [when they beat City] but over a long period, our consistency’s been bad. It’s something that we do need to nail down, starting with Thursday. “We also have to realise that we are still where we are in the league table [13th]. We can’t rest because the league table to look at is embarrassing. We all have belief that we should be a lot higher. To be sat where we are, it’s nowhere near good enough. It’s down to us to change it. We’ve got to go on a little run.” Maguire was ill with the flu last week and missed training on Friday but he produced a nine out of 10 performance against Arsenal and believes he has worked his way back to his best. “I think my first couple of years at United were probably the best part of my career,” he said. “I’m getting back to that level. I think I was also at that level last season so it’s been 18 months now where I’d say I’ve been playing consistently well for this club again. “There’s no doubt I had a tough year in my third season [in 2021-22]. I knew I needed to find something to stay at this club because it demands high standards and I feel like I’ve found something. “Ruben said to me that when it came across to him that I had an option [for a contract extension], it was a no-brainer for him. It’s given me confidence and belief that they want me at the club and part of this project.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/13/harry-maguire-arsenal-penalty-need-var-manchester-united-zirkzee', 'David Hytner', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a52030d06a5ce834e7cf29cbd096a3d226c9d5/0_3_4859_2915/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 10:00:11', NULL, NULL),
(201, 'us-news/2025/jan/13/trump-vance-access-cost-inauguration', 'Access to Trump and Vance is twice as expensive for donors at inauguration', 'The Guardian', 'US news', 'Exclusive: dinners with both the president and vice president-elect will cost $1m, up from $500,000', 'Major donors to Donald Trump’s inaugural committee are having to contribute twice as much to get direct access to him and vice-president-elect JD Vance at private events around the swearing-in ceremony compared with the first inauguration, according to fundraising materials. The ability to briefly interact with Trump and Vance requires donors to contribute at least $1m to the committee – the highest-tier ticket package – in a marked increase from the previous cycle when the same access cost $500,000. That top-tier package provides donors and lobbyists seeking to curry favor with the second Trump administration with two tickets to a dinner with the vice president-elect and six tickets to the “candlelight dinner” where Trump will be in attendance. The increased donation amounts needed to have face time with Trump and Vance reflects the dramatic increase in demand to get on his good side after a divisive election where many deep-pocketed donors stood on the sidelines waiting to see the outcome. With Trump’s imminent return to the White House and his known personal interest in who has supported him, according to people familiar with the matter, a number of people expected to have business before the federal government have made major donations at the $1m level. The inaugural committee has raised over $170m and expects to ultimately receive $200m, the people said, meaning the committee is overfunded and has paid for the costs to put on the various receptions, lunches, dinners and balls several times over. At this late stage, one transition official suggested, it would be a better return on investment for donors to contribute large sums to Trump-allied political action committees rather than make token $100,000 or even $250,000 contributions to the inaugural committee. “Prospective donors wouldn’t even be noticed – or appreciated – at that level,” the official said, reflecting the consensus view that the situation may be a harbinger of the increased cost of gaining access to Trump or retaining influence in Trumpworld over the next four years. There are five tiers of ticket packages, according to the fundraising materials – for donating $1m, $500,000, $250,000, $100,000 or $50,000. To get access to the candlelight dinner with Trump and the vice-president’s dinner with Vance, donors would need to have contributed at the $1m level. A $500,000 contribution would limit access to only the candlelight dinner, unlike in 2017 when it was enough for both. Promotional materials describe the “candlelight dinner” held at the National Building Museum in Washington as a black-tie dinner attended by Trump and Melania Trump. The vice-president’s dinner is billed as a more intimate black-tie event at the National Gallery of Art. But even a $1m contribution buys less access than it did at Trump’s first inauguration, where donors got four tickets to a “leadership luncheon” billed as an “exclusive event with select special guests of Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership”. There is no such lunch this time. The reduced schedule suggests that to get deep access with Trumpworld, donors and lobbyists might be better served attending private parties hosted by Trump’s allies that are separate from the official inaugural committee’s packages. The private parties that are likely to be attended by senior Trump officials include an event co-hosted by allies of Donald Trump Jr allies Jeff Miller and Arthur Schwartz, an event hosted by Turning Point’s Charlie Kirk, an event by Steve Bannon, and an event by the Maga Inc political action committee. Donors who contribute at lower levels might not get access to events attended by Trump, but they could still get face time with cabinet officials. To get tickets for the cabinet reception, donors can contribute at the lowest tier of $50,000, which interestingly is half of the cost in 2017.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/trump-vance-access-cost-inauguration', 'Hugo Lowell in Washington', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/c9d60e2ee9fc2a4960a24b1e8ca4a91fbf83db0d/1032_58_3966_2379/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 10:00:03', NULL, NULL),

The airline has called on European authorities to bring in new curbs on alcohol to stop passengers getting drunk before boarding a plane. Airlines reserve the right to deny boarding to anyone they deem to be excessively intoxicated. However, Ryanair now wants airports to require boarding passes be shown when passengers purchase alcohol at airport bars and pubs as they are in duty free shops. “We fail to understand why passengers at airports are not limited to two alcoholic drinks (using their boarding pass in exactly the same way they limit duty free sales), as this would result in safer and better passenger behaviour on board aircraft, and a safer travel experience for passengers and crews all over Europe,”the airline said on Monday. “During flight delays, passengers are consuming excess alcohol at airports without any limit on purchase or consumption,” it added. This month, Ryanair revealed it was suing an unidentified passenger for €15,000 in an effort to recover costs when the flight from Dublin to Lanzarote was redirected to Porto last April. In its case against the individual, being brought in Irish courts, the airline is claiming €7,000 for hotel costs for 160 passengers and crew, €2,500 in landing and handling fees at the Portuguese airport and €1,800 in the cost of replacing the crew because of restrictions on flying hours. Ryanair is also demanding the passenger cover €800 for excess fuel costs, €750 in loss of inflight sales and €2,500 in Portuguese legal fees. The airline said: “None of these costs could have been incurred if this disruptive passenger had not forced a diversion to Porto”. Aircraft crews already have the right not to serve alcohol to passengers but Ryanair is now looking for legal limits in airports across Europe where the airline operate 3,600 flights a day in 37 countries. “It is time that EU authorities take action to limit the sale of alcohol at airports,” it said. Most airports in Europe sell alcohol, with British airports offering a range of high street style pubs. Ryanair staff claim the problem is not so much with passengers drinking on the plane but with those who get inebriated at an airport, seem under control when they get on board and then become unruly during a flight. After the Lanzarote flight was diverted last year the airline launched legal action in Portugal but the Portuguese prosecution authorities ruled that because the aircraft and the passenger were Irish the case should be heard in Dublin. “Ryanair is therefore taking a civil proceeding against this passenger in the Irish courts to recover these costs, which were incurred wholly and exclusively as a result of the disruptive passenger’s behaviour, which caused not just a diversion, but an overnight in Porto of over 160 passengers and six crew member and the operating aircraft,” said the airline.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/13/ryanair-calls-for-limit-of-two-alcoholic-drinks-at-airports-in-europe', 'Lisa O\'Carroll in Dublin', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a3de793a9aa42eeec302710f0283f563f3cd51b3/0_117_3500_2101/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 10:40:01', NULL, NULL),

I never saw Michel Saint-Denis’s 1951 Old Vic production but I did talk about it extensively to its Electra, Peggy Ashcroft, and she gave me a crucial insight into the play. She told me she had seen a Saint-Denis drama school production and found “it was so modern and accessible that I wanted to do it – it was like a female Hamlet.” Many others made the same comparison. Eric Keown, Ashcroft’s first biographer, pointed out that in both Shakespeare and Sophocles, “royal fathers (Agamemnon in the latter case) had been murdered to make way for intolerable marriages and both Hamlet and Electra stood out in lonely protest”. Even if the reviews questioned both Barbara Hepworth’s design and the use of the chorus (“a row of slightly paralysed debutantes”), there seems little doubt that Dame Peg had the grieving solitude we associate with the Danish prince. The Hamlet parallels were there again in the stunning for the RSC production that Deborah Warner staged in 1988. In Kenneth McLeish’s version the heroine cried “I am like Niobe, all tears.” Fiona Shaw’s Electra was also torn apart, Hamlet-like, by the idea of her mother, Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus making love in her murdered father’s bed. But another reason for the play’s magnificence hit me: Sophocles’ supreme irony. When Natasha Parry’s Clytemnestra pointed out that she had sought a just revenge on Agamemnon for the sacrifice of their daughter, Iphigenia, Shaw furiously replied “Blood for blood, is that your law?” oblivious to the fact that she herself was driven by precisely the same motive. Every production, in fact, reveals something new. In 1997 David Leveaux directed a Frank McGuinness version of the play, first at Chichester and then at the Donmar, with Zoe Wanamaker as Electra: a superb performance that combined obsessive grief, sexual disgust and overpowering filial love. But with Electra clad clad like a shabby refugee and the chorus made up of black-dressed, handbag-clutching women, we were constantly reminded of the very recent Bosnia war that had left the city of Sarajevo under brutal siege for four years. The production also stressed that a measure of Sophocles’s greatness is his moral objectivity. While he vividly presents Electra’s suffering, he sees that her compromising sister, Chrysothemis, and their mother, Clytemnestra, have their point of view and that the blood-cycle started with the slaughter of Iphigenia when Agamemnon “cut her soft white throat”. The most recent Electra was Ian Rickson’s 2014 Old Vic production, again using the McGuinness version, with Kristin Scott-Thomas as the vengeful heroine. For the first time I became aware of Electra as a thwarted mother: at one point Scott-Thomas cradled the urn supposedly containing the ashes of her brother, Orestes, as if it were the baby she had never had. Both actor and director also averted the danger of monomania by showing that Greek tragedy was not without its savage humour. After Clytemnestra had greeted a servant bringing news of the death of Orestes, Scott-Thomas, got a big laugh by announcing “her welcome was not cold”. So this is a play that combines formal perfection, profound passion, scrupulous fairness and sharp irony. In his acclaimed production of Oklahoma!, Daniel Fish revealed the dark undercurrents to this musical of pastoral romance and territorial celebration. With several of the same cast, including Patrick Vaill and Greg Hicks and with the great Stockard Channing as Clytemnestra, it will be fascinating to see whether he can shed new light on Sophocles just as he did on Rodgers and Hammerstein. • Elektra is at Theatre Royal Brighton, 13-18 January, and Duke of York’s theatre, London, 24 January-12 April', 'https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/13/sophocles-electra-brie-larson-theatre-royal-brighton-duke-of-york-s-theatre-london', 'Michael Billington', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a2ef63fee9dc79d8c6e51f8573410b5e39c57a/0_291_3195_1917/500.jpg', '2025-01-13 10:37:17', NULL, NULL),

Ryan Wellings, 30, was blamed from “beyond the grave” for the death of his partner, Kiena Dawes. Wellings denied manslaughter and was found not guilty by a jury after a six-week trial at Preston crown court. He was convicted of assault and of coercive and controlling behaviour and will be sentenced at a later date. Dawes, a 23-year-old hairdresser and mother of an eight-month-old baby, took her own life in July 2022, leaving a note on her phone that read: “I fought hard. I fought long. I went through pain no one could imagine … I was murdered. Slowly … Ryan Wellings killed me.” But the defence barrister, John Jones KC, said Dawes had been a “very troubled young lady” with a history of mental health problems and suicide attempts. In his closing speech Jones said the couple’s “party lifestyle” of alcohol and drugs had been a “recipe for disaster”. He said their “fairytale” relationship had ended in turmoil because of Wellings’ temper and Dawes’ mental health difficulties – and their liking for cocaine. He told the jury: “This corrosive and destructive combination was to bring heartache to them both, and death to one. It was a recipe for disaster. Mental health on one side, drug abuse and temper on the other.” The jury heard that Dawes, from Fleetwood, and Wellings, from Bispham, both in Lancashire, had met in January 2020.

(212, 'football/2025/jan/13/transfer-latest-chelsea-renato-veiga-dortmund', 'Aston Villa agree initial £20m deal to buy Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund', 'The Guardian', 'Football', 'Chelsea are asking for more than £20m to sell Renato Veiga, who is wanted by Borussia Dortmund on loan with an option to buy', 'Aston Villa have struck a deal with Borussia Dortmund to sign Donyell Malen in a package worth an initial £20m. Unai Emery is poised to make the Dutchman, a longtime target, his first signing of the year. Emery admires forwards who can play across several positions and Malen, who has won 41 caps for the Netherlands, will bolster his front line, which features Ollie Watkins, Jhon Durán, Morgan Rogers and Leon Bailey. Malen has scored five goals in 21 matches for Dortmund this season. Emery was attracted to Rogers, a revelation after arriving from Middlesbrough last January in a £15m deal, in part owing to his versatility. Malen was an influential part of the Dortmund team that reached last season’s Champions League final, in which Villa’s summer signing Ian Maatsen also played. Villa plan to make a couple more signings, with Celta Vigo’s full-back Óscar Mingueza another priority target. Villa’s president of football operations, Monchi, was in Spain last week to watch the 25-year-old defender. The Spain international would provide competition for Matty Cash and potentially allow Kosta Nedeljkovic to depart on loan. Villa could face a tricky decision on Durán if European heavyweights such as Paris-Saint Germain crystallise their interest in the Colombia forward. Durán would command a huge fee after scoring 12 goals in 26 games this season. The Villa winger Jaden Philogene, who returned in the summer from Hull, is likely to depart this month, with Ipswich the frontrunners to sign him. Diego Carlos, one of the club’s high earners, is in talks over a move to Fenerbahce. Offloading Carlos would help Villa comply with profitability and sustainability regulations. Chelsea are asking for more than £20m to sell Renato Veiga, who is wanted by Dortmund on loan with an option to buy. Veiga, who can play at left-back, centre-back or in central midfield, is keen for a new challenge despite joining Chelsea for £12m from FC Basel last summer. The 21-year-old, who is said to have agreed terms with Dortmund, has made seven Premier League appearances and is keen to find regular football. It is thought that Veiga’s desire to leave is partly down to his aim to secure a place in Portugal’s squad for the 2026 World Cup. However Chelsea do not want to let him out on loan and are adamant they will consider only a permanent deal. The club could make a profit if Veiga, who has also been linked with Napoli, is sold. It could still be a risk, though, given that Veiga provides cover for Marc Cucurella at left-back. Ben Chilwell is out of favour and will be allowed to leave, although firm interest in the England left-back is yet to materialise. Chelsea could need a new back-up for Cucurella if Veiga goes. Enzo Maresca, Chelsea’s head coach, acknowledged Veiga’s situation before Tuesday’s home game against Bournemouth. Maresca dropped the youngster from the squad for last month’s league game against Fulham for “technical reasons”. Veiga has started only one league game and has mostly been used in cup competitions. He started at left-back when Chelsea beat Morecambe 5-0 in the FA Cup on Saturday and has been a regular in the Europa Conference League. Chelsea are open to sales and could also allow the midfielders Kieran Dewsbury-Hall and Carney Chukwuemeka to leave. Dewsbury-Hall joined from Leicester last summer and has interest from West Ham. Chukwuemeka has a £40m buyout clause. Money raised through sales could help Chelsea fund a move for a centre-back, with Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi in their sights.
